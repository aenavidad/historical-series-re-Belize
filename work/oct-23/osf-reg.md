## abstract
written 11 oct 2023 17.53 belmopan. this document details the expected structure of, expected content of, expected standards for, and expected process for, version 1.5 of dataset ie data series.[^expected by 31 Dec 2023 in at least `github` at [v-1.5](https://github.com/aenavidad/historical-series-re-Belize/tree/main/v-1.5) and `osf` at [version 1.5](https://osf.io/27mx5/).]

## structure
version 1.5 ought to be composed of exactly six data series ie directories (`calendar`, `chronicle`, `compendium`, `catalogue`, `gazetteer`, `dictionary`) and exactly one descriptive ie introductory text file (`readme.md` or similar text file) and \\(n\\) supplementary text files *referenced* in the `readme` for \\(0\leq n\\) (eg a `licence.md` file referred to in the relevant `readme.md` section) and nothing else.

1. note0 / conventions, etc = 
    - i / 'na' and '999' are null vals, cols with names starting in '\*' are working cols,
    - ii / col 'no' identifies the corresponding standard number per `work/aug-22/rules-20-aug-2022.tsv` for nos=1-316 or assigns an identifying number for the same if not available, 
    - iii / col 'top' identifies the subsuming top level ie first order standard from nos=1-3, 
    - iv / col 'varid' identifies the standard by a variant id eg that assigned by the source of the standard,
    - v / col 'source' identifies the standard's original source. 
2. note1 / sources = 
    - i / nos=1-10, 400 from `work/aug-22/rules-20-aug-2022.md` s 3,
    - ii / nos=1-316 from `work/aug-22/rules-20-aug-2022.tsv`.[^with col 'varid' vals adapted from col 'standard' vals, and col 'adoption' vals 'full' or 'part' from col 'adoption' val 'yes', and val 'none' from val 'no']
3. note2 / defined terms in cols 'standard', 'elucidation', 'notes' =

    - ii / `v 1.5` is `historical-series-re-Belize/v-1.5`, 
    - iii / `source data` is `pre-git-hist`, 
    - iv / `work files` are those in `historical-series-re-Belize/work/*-23` for \* = nov or dec *in addition to* those in `historical-series-re-Belize/work/oct-23` created after \\(n\\) for \\(n\\) = date and time of `osf` registration submission,[^assuming submission in oct 2023 and `work` completed during \\(n\\) to 31 dec 2023.]
    - v / `pre work` is process to `pre-git-hist`.[^occurred oct 2020 to aug 2022.]
