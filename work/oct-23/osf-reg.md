## abstract
written 11 oct 2023 17.53 belmopan. this document details the expected structure of, expected content of, expected standards for, and expected process for, version 1.5 of dataset ie data series.[^expected by 31 Dec 2023 in at least `github` at [v-1.5](https://github.com/aenavidad/historical-series-re-Belize/tree/main/v-1.5) and `osf` at [version 1.5](https://osf.io/27mx5/).]

## structure
version 1.5 ought to be composed of exactly six data series ie directories (`calendar`, `chronicle`, `compendium`, `catalogue`, `gazetteer`, `dictionary`) and exactly one descriptive ie introductory text file (`readme.md` or similar text file) and \\(n\\) supplementary text files *referenced* in the `readme` for \\(0\leq n\\) (eg a `licence.md` file referred to in the relevant `readme.md` section) and nothing else.

## standards
we first set out top level ie first order standards. note the following terms,[^terms and first order stds copied or adapted from [[work/aug-22/process-0]] as identified in the 16 aug 2022 `osf` registration.]
- `source data` are data contained in files tagged for extraction in `work/oct-23/draft-draft0s7files.tsv`,
- `version 1.5` are data defined in ss 2â€“3 of this document,
- `work` is the `source data` to `version 1.5` process detailed in s 6 'process' of this document.

| no | standard | adoption |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | `work` must be replicable | partial |
| 2 | `version 1.5` must be human readable | all |
| 3 | `version 1.5` must be machine readable | none |

we now set out lower level ie second order standards.
