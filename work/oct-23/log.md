## log

1. [ ] ~~get [[sep-23/draft0]] into tex format at `draft.tex` and `draft-*.tex`,[^abandoned for no 2 at some point before 2 oct 2023 19.10, but ought to return to this ofc]~~
    1. [x] get structure,
    2. [ ] ~~copy over existing content,~~
    3. [x] add draft semver versioning to supplementary section,
    4. [x] copy draft0 s 4.1,[^with revisions]
    5. [x] copy draft0 s 4.1,[^with revisions]
2. [x] add draft definitions or elucidations of key terms to glossary in supplementary section of `draft.tex`
3. [x] transfer all notes to this log or to `draft.tex`,[^during no 2, vars notes were written down in paper or on the Notes app]
    4. [x] transfer from Notes,
    5. [x] from notebook,
4. [x] expand versioning portino of supplementary section of `draft.tex`,[^or rather of `work/sep-23/draft0-s-7-*.tsv` which will be imported or simply accompany `draft.tex`]
    1. [x] for files in `work/sep-23/draft0-s-7-files.tsv`, disregard non-tsv files,
    2. [x] add the nn.nnnn.nnnn file-level versioning data to their corresponding (those with filepaths not ending in some date-month.numbers sequence) files except that we now follow the sketch of series as provided in `draft.tex` ie excluding metadata (as a series but not as metadata itself), collapsing all statistics series into single stats series, and so on,
    3. [x] may further want to add versioning data from `work/versioning`,
    4. [x] complete versioning data in a manner following 4.2 or 4.3 above,[^inc addition of 14 Numbers-versioned files to `work/oct-23/draft-draft0s7files.tsv` and to relevant parts of `pre-git-hist`]
    5. [x] check `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` to ensure *every* named `tsv` file with a 'created file' event prior to 4 Nov 2021 appears on `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`,[^check passed]
    6. [x] see if any of the 'created file' events prior to 4 Nov 2021 described as 're pre-existing data' ought to also be included in `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`,[^cross reference creation dates with those listed on 'Numbers' folder of local hard drive - which contains all `.numbers` files - check passed as all such files appear to be non-original data from third-party databases - ie no new files added to `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`]
    7. [x] add versioning data in *chains* for the persons ie identities series to `work/oct-23/draft-*versioning.tsv`,
    8. [x] repeat no 4.7 above for places ie gazetteer ie towns series,
    9. [x] repeat no 4.7 for calendar ie cartas ie extracts series,
    10. [x] repeat no 4.7 for sources ie catalogue ie bibliography series,[^here use `work/versioning/sources.tsv` but extend to files without varids]
    11. [x] review values in `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv` as these will be used for versioning and provenance,
    12. [x] review values from 4.7-4.10 above with values from 4.11,
    13. [x] repeat no 4.10 for events,
    14. [x] repeat no 4.10 for statistics,
    15. [x] review values from 4.13-4.14 with values from 4.11,
5. [x] vars updates to `draft-*.tsv`,
6. [x] add missing `.numbers` files to `pre-git-hist/sheets`,[^namely, those files in the local `/Numbers/` ie in local disc which had `.tsv` copies in `pre-git-hist/files/` ie which were recorded in `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` but which were not yet in `pre-git-hist/sheets/` ie not in `pre-git-hist/sheets.tsv` - in the end 33 such files were committed]
7. [x] verify all files just committed in no 6 really ought to have been committed,[^all are named in `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` it seems - from quick look through on 9 oct 2023 06.01]
8. [x] add any local `.numbers` versions of files in no 6 above,[^if available in Numbers app, except do not add for files with 'created' and 'last-edited' values within the same day, and further do not add for files of only recycled data eg `found scrap 1.2.numbers` or of only scraped data eg `oclc serials 1.1.numbers`]
9. [x] recent addition to wikipedia outside of git not added to `pre-git-hist` as these additions post-date aug 2022 despite being outside of git,
10. [x] add to `draft-*files.tsv` those `pre-git-hist/sheets` files added on 9 oct 2023 and named files in `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` not already present,[^to create a *master* list containing all files in `pre-git-hist/sheets` and all those in `pre-git-hist/*` for `*` not equal to `harv` nor `wiki`, resulting in a `draft-*files.tsv` of 531 records]
11. [x] add series  or metadata present or absence data for files added during no 10 above,
12. [x] check existing chains in `draft-*versioning.tsv` to ensure chronology was maintained upon addition of new fiels in no 10 above,[^it was kept]
13. [ ] ~~check existing chains in `draft-*versioning.tsv` for completeness,[^seems taxing for little benefit - may return to complete later]~~
14. [ ] ~~add missing chains to `draft-*versioning.tsv`~~
15. [ ] build ~~pre-~~registration for `pre-git-hist` to `v-1.5` move for `v-1.5` as 1.0.0-alpha as per `work/oct-23/draft.tex` s presenting the version,
    1. [ ] update files stored in `osf` such that it mirrors those in `pre-git-hist` and `historical-series-re-Belize`,[^organised in two sub-project components (`pre-git work` for `pre-git-hist` files, and `post-git work` for `historical-series-re-Belize` files. the required project components could not be created for technical reasons by 10 oct 2023 20.49 - it seems project was marked as spam by `osf`, so have gotta sort that before bring osf files up to date.)]
    2. [ ] once `osf`-stored files are up to date, create a new registration draft for the project,
    3. [ ] fill in draft with [[work/oct-23/osf-draft.md]] content (may have to clean up),
16. [ ] xx.
