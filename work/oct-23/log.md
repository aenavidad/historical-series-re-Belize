## log

1. [ ] ~~get [[sep-23/draft0]] into tex format at `draft.tex` and `draft-*.tex`,[^abandoned for no 2 at some point before 2 oct 2023 19.10, but ought to return to this ofc]~~
    1. [x] get structure,
    2. [ ] ~~copy over existing content,~~
    3. [x] add draft semver versioning to supplementary section,
    4. [x] copy draft0 s 4.1,[^with revisions]
    5. [x] copy draft0 s 4.1,[^with revisions]
2. [x] add draft definitions or elucidations of key terms to glossary in supplementary section of `draft.tex`
3. [x] transfer all notes to this log or to `draft.tex`,[^during no 2, vars notes were written down in paper or on the Notes app]
    4. [x] transfer from Notes,
    5. [x] from notebook,
4. [x] expand versioning portino of supplementary section of `draft.tex`,[^or rather of `work/sep-23/draft0-s-7-*.tsv` which will be imported or simply accompany `draft.tex`]
    1. [x] for files in `work/sep-23/draft0-s-7-files.tsv`, disregard non-tsv files,
    2. [x] add the nn.nnnn.nnnn file-level versioning data to their corresponding (those with filepaths not ending in some date-month.numbers sequence) files except that we now follow the sketch of series as provided in `draft.tex` ie excluding metadata (as a series but not as metadata itself), collapsing all statistics series into single stats series, and so on,
    3. [x] may further want to add versioning data from `work/versioning`,
    4. [x] complete versioning data in a manner following 4.2 or 4.3 above,[^inc addition of 14 Numbers-versioned files to `work/oct-23/draft-draft0s7files.tsv` and to relevant parts of `pre-git-hist`]
    5. [x] check `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` to ensure *every* named `tsv` file with a 'created file' event prior to 4 Nov 2021 appears on `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`,[^check passed]
    6. [x] see if any of the 'created file' events prior to 4 Nov 2021 described as 're pre-existing data' ought to also be included in `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`,[^cross reference creation dates with those listed on 'Numbers' folder of local hard drive - which contains all `.numbers` files - check passed as all such files appear to be non-original data from third-party databases - ie no new files added to `work/oct-23/draft-*files.tsv`]
    7. [x] add versioning data in *chains* for the persons ie identities series to `work/oct-23/draft-*versioning.tsv`,
    8. [x] repeat no 4.7 above for places ie gazetteer ie towns series,
    9. [x] repeat no 4.7 for calendar ie cartas ie extracts series,
    10. [x] repeat no 4.7 for sources ie catalogue ie bibliography series,[^here use `work/versioning/sources.tsv` but extend to files without varids]
5. [ ] xx.
