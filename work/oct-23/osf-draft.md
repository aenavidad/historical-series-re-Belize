## abstract

this file written 10 oct 2023 18.28 belmopan as part of [[work/oct-23/log.md]] no 15. contains free-text for an `osf` registration.[^for `osf` project [7UJQ5](https://osf.io/7ujq5/) with one prior registration [5BYHM](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5BYHM) *once* said project has been updated as per (i) to (vi) for (i) a data-component 'version 1.5' has been added to the project to hold the expected data output; (ii) two sub-project components 'pre-git work' and 'post-git work' have been added to hold all working files; (iii) all `pre-git-hist` files have been copied into component 'pre-git work'; (iv) all `historical-series-re-Belize` files have been copied into component 'post-git work'; (v) github copy of `pre-git-hist` has been linked to 'pre-git work'; (vi) github copy of `historical-series-re-Belize` has been linked to 'post-git work']

## free-form reasoning

we'd like to know
1. sx of 1.0.0-alpha
2. standards to be met by 1.0.0-alpha
3. standards for and steps in `pre-git-hist` to 1.0.0-alpha process

now, will we update or withdraw the 16 aug 2022 registration https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/5BYHM
- this registraiton is for 1.5 ie 1.0.0 ie human-and-machine readable dataset
- withdrawal deletes content, so we may not really wanna do that
- so we must update the current registration or create a completely new one
- updates seem to be for extenuating circumstances only, but that doesn't seem to apply in this case,
- so we ought to create a new registration for the same project
- suitability of multiple registrations for the same project confirmed in https://nyu-dataservices.gitlab.io/rdm-instruction/project-management-with-the-osf.html
- see how-to at https://help.osf.io/article/345-create-registrations
- seems we'll want an open-ended registration type

to assign correct licence, we need a list of publicly shared version of data and their licences[^note any deposit of `v-1.4` would state in the introductory `tsv` file that the dataset was licensed CC BY NC 4.0. this file *might not* be the only one to declare a licence.]
