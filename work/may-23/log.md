# 24 may

1. review of `work/dec-22/`[^given `work/feb-23/` is empty]
    - of [[iCloud: hist pp notes]][^per [[non-git-log]].]
        - list of prev publications on after which preprint may be modelled (43 sources, 25 reviewed, 18 to-review),
        - list of bzean historiography literature from which content may be gotten (6 sources, 0 reviewed, 6 to-review),
    - of [[free-text-nov-25]]
        - list of 3 sections we want in preprint[^other than std sections like intro, cf sec `log` no 6],
        - content for vars said sections[^cf sec `output`]
    - of [[pp]][^inc `pp.numbers`]
        - `md` virtually null, though a few lines of content for preprint[^for intro of]
        - `numbers` virtually useless, as data copied in sec `output` of [[free-text-nov-25]]
    - of [[v-log]]
        - content for one section as identified in [[free-text-nov-25]]
2. now extract useful parts of content reviewed in no 1 to [[out]]
    - detour fm extraction to [SEP art re hist](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/history/),
    - detour fm extration to [WIK art on hist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_history),
    - detour fm extraction to [Paul 2015](https://www.routledge.com/Key-Issues-in-Historical-Theory/Paul/p/book/9781138802735),[^ref fm SEP sec 3.4]
    - detour fm extraction to [Bethell 1995](https://doi.org/10.1017/CHOL9780521395250),
3. now figure out what maths or anls tools ought or may be used for subsx listed in [[out]] sec `24 may` subsec 2 `context subsx`
    - first, quick google query, returned [Neuendorf 2016](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/the-content-analysis-guidebook/book234078) on coding, [Liu 2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/23270012.2016.1214540) on algorithms,[^cf their refs eg [Porch 2015](https://eprints.qut.edu.au/110341/).][^further cf [[iCloud: hist pp notes]] sec `table` subsec 3.1 `for general sources`]
    - then, quick scan of model preprints et articles in [[iCloud: hist pp notes]], returned none,[^though cf articles deemed `good` therein]
4. now develop presentation and supplement content in [[out]]
    - first, finish log part of supplement,[^on completing subsections of [[out]] sec 2.3 `supplement content`, will likely need *s* csv tables to finish versioning for *s* number of versions deemed fit for versioning in each sec 2.3 subsec, and where each such csv table is normalised to march records, rows, and columns to make csv diff easy to see.]

# 25 may

1. continue s `24 may` no 4 fn 11
    - first, list all files to be used for *s* csv tables in [[out]] s 3.1,[^more fully listed in [[out-sup0.tsv]], w desc of vars in [[out]] s 3.1.1]
    - and, strike out superseded content in [[out]],[^all of s 2.3]
