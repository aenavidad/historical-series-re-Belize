# tasks

1. [x] add list of source files to [[out1]],[^list of file-related events included in [[out1-sup0]].]
2. [ ] ~~update metadata versioning,~~
    - [ ] ~~get current single-file versioning into multi-file granular format,~~
    - [ ] ~~review `nn` id files for missed metadata attd to data (eg captions),~~
    - [ ] ~~review `nn.n` id files for metadata,~~
3. [ ] ~~update sources versioning,~~
4. [ ] ~~finish events versioning,~~
5. [ ] ~~stop at no 2, now rather version records retroactively from 4 nov 2021 (date deposited) following non-creation events in [[out1-sup0]],~~
    - [x] ~~do 00 4 nov,~~
    - [x] ~~do 01.i 1 Nov~~
    - [x] ~~do 01.h 1 nov,~~
    - [x] ~~do 01.e 31 oct,~~
    - [ ] ~~do rest of 01 to 26 oct,~~
6. [ ] stop no 5, now add `v-1.4/versioning` directory to contain versioning output, and inc `tsv` files for each record type, and add versioning data,
    - [x] add `v-1.4/versioning`,
    - [x] add `tsv` files for each record type,
    - [x] stop at adding versioning data,
7. [ ] to add versioning data, for each record type `tsv`,[^ie calendar, events, identities, metadata, places, sources, statistics `tsv` files in `v-1.4/versioning`]
    - [ ] get records groupings in `v 1.4`,[usually, 'data series' as per Table 0 of `Introduction-*.tsv`]
    - [ ] fill in columns up to col `000` as per usual,
    - [ ] fill in columns up to col `288` as per cross-reference to `pre-git-hist/sheets/`,[^start with varids not ending in `0` nor `5`, confirm record-type coverage in `historical-series-re-Belize/work/may-23/out1.md`, on coverage confirmation, match varids to files in `historical-series-re-Belize/v-1.4/versioning/sheets varids.tsv`, and cross-reference with files in `pre-git-hist/sheets/`, then repeat for varids ending in `0` or `5`] [^val `1` only for record groups identical to matching records in `v 1.4`, ignoring blank lines, as confirmed by machine / val `x` for records trivially present or absent but having dedicated space eg as indicated by placeholder / val `d` for records non-trivially present but not identical to matching records in `v 1.4` / val `0` for records absent and lacking dedicated space eg as indicated by placeholder]
    - [ ] for all, review vals for columns up to col `288` by cross-reference to `historical-series-re-Belize/work/may-23/out1.md`,
    - [ ] for `metadata.tsv` and `sources.tsv`, review vals for columns up to col `288` by cross-reference to `work/may-23/out0-supn.tsv`,
    - [ ] for all, review appropriateness of records groupings given in columns up to col `000`,[^where, *a0,...,an* are the 'natural record groupings' ie those groupings presented in `pre-git-hist/sheets/` (eg by being presented as a table or sheet, eg `v 1.4` would have at least xx natural record groupings eg `Sources`, `Sources 2`, etc), and where each *ai* is a set of (*v0*, *v1*) pairs for variable *v0* and corresponding value *v1* / in which case, an appropriate record grouping is a union *ai0,...,aik* where, for any *ai* and *aj* in the union, *ai* is not disjoint from *aj* (ie they share at least on (*v0*, *v1*) pair).]
    - [ ] for all, note all ambiguities, uncertainties in last lines of `tsv` file,[^from `note0` to `noten`]
8. [x] do no 7 for `v-1.4/versioning/metadata.tsv`,[^ie metadata versioning deemed complete for record-groups on 31 may 2023 at 16.40]
