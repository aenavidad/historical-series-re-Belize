## rules

following [[iCloud:hist pp notes]], we divide records into -
1. statistics or numbers,
2. bibliography or sources, 
3. personal authorities or identities or names, 
4. calendars or extracts or transcriptions, 
5. spatial authorities or identities or names, 
6. temporal events,
7. all else.

though might be better to use standardised vocab for these?[^might take too long to do this so left this for a later time on 5 dec 2022 at 1.53 est]
