# abstract

free text for pre-print for version 1.4 of historical series. begun on 25 nov 2022 at 23.58 est in east boston, ma.

# log

1. we want to know what pre-1.4 versions of the data looked like, and ideally know a bit more about where those came from, and when,
    - so we skim pre-git-hist directory,
    - output to table 1,
    - stop output to table 1, as file-by-file listing seems to be taking to long, instead move to step 3,
2. detour at 26 nov 2022 on 0.13 to skim stuff on semantic versioning as may be helpful here,
    - *semver* seems geared towards software, so we need something geared towards data,
    - skim [klump](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-012) for data-specific semantic versioning,
    - klump confirms no consensus best practice for versioning of data cf intro sec.,
    - klump = most recent [rda](https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/54345/outputs) output per intro sec.,
    - klump rules in *six data versioning principles* sec.,
    - stop detour on 1.46 to continue step 1,
3. skim pre-git-hist/events.tsv to output table 2,
    - break at 2.24 on 26 nov,
    - return at 2.53 on 26 nov,
    - breat at 3.12 on 26 nov,
    - return at 6.15 on 26 nov,
    - break at 7.16 on 26 nov,
    - continue at 13.22 on 26 nov,
    - break at 18.05 on 26 nov,
    - continue at c 19.00 to c 19.15 on 26 nov,
    - break at 19.36 on 26 nov,
    - continue at 3.12 on 27 nov,
    - break at 4.38 on 27 nov,
    - continue at 5.01 on 27 nov,
    - done at 5.40 on 27 nov,
4. may now need specifics regarding versioning and provenance needed for version 1.4,
    - earliest metadata standards possibly related to [MARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_standards) dating to 1965-1968,
    - vars metadata stds listed in [wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata_standard), in [ands post](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/data-management/data-versioning), in [klump](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-012) ie [rda](https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/54345/outputs),
    - vars provenance stds listed in [w3c prov](https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/), [jauer](https://doi.org/10.3233/shti200380), [eu scds](https://eudatasharing.eu/technical-aspects/data-provenance-part-1), [ardc](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/data-provenance/),
5. skim vars metadata and provenance stds located in step 4 and output in this step the relevant metadata, versioning, provenance values we need for datasets listed in output table 2,
    - may be standardised or not, in human-readable format, machine-readable format,
    - must record where data comes from (origin) and how it was processed (movement),
    - may record source data licenses, esp for data in v-1.4,
    - may want to retroactively record or estimate minimal fit-for-use requirements listed by [jauer](https://doi.org/10.3233/shti200380) sec. 3, at least for those datasets in output table 2 deemed to have contributed to v-1.4,
    - may want to retroactively record or estimate the six data versioning principles listed by [klump](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-012) seventh sec., at least for those datasets in output table 2 deemed to have contributed to v-1.4,
6. now want to skim [[iCloud:hist pp notes.md]] for model articles accompanying historical dataset releases to see what exactly our pre-print for v-1.4 should look like,
    - inc abstract, conclusion, and so on, obviously, 
    - in introductory / contextual section inc some notes on historiography eg accuracy as regards facts, eg biases or trends, eg access or availability of primary sources, non-interpretative secondary sources, their accuracy, and so on,
    - in presentation / description section inc some notes on size, precision / accuracy / quality of data in v-1.4 (picture), inc notes on data collection and construction of data in v-1.4 (history),
    - in appendix section inc codebook ie descriptions of variables and values in v-1.4 (codebook), log of changes between versions, revisions, or releases (log).
7. now want to ouput text re notes on historiography in output text 1,
8. want to output tsv data re literature to be covered in pre-print section on notes on historiography, at 20.59 on 27 nov, with output to pp.numbers,
9. stop step 8 at 21.20 on 27 nov, as seems like this could go on forever despite its serving only an auxiliary function in the pre-print, so rather pivot towards what is meant to the bulk of the pre-pring, ie presentation / description section, for which we need more detail in the step 6, so we now continue step 6,
10. re building log, as per step 6, as of 3 dec 2022 at 16.54 est, we'd like to â€“ 
    - know whether any files created between 22 oct 2020 to 14 nov 2020 contributed anythign to v 1.4 of data,
        - files created 22 oct 2020, 2 nov 2020, 11 nov 2020[^this one re human rights had event data but seems mostly crime related so likely not included in E nor E2 series of v-1.4], 13 nov 2020, 14 nov 2020[^this one re public finances had stat and finance data but was not included in Estimate nor Finances series of v-1.4] did not from cursory skim,
        - so none of these files contributed to v-1.4 of data as per cursory skims by 3 dec 2022 on 17.11 est,
    - get lost copy of red/HURR BZ V1 *.tsv,
        - found copy at /Users/angelnavidad/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~Numbers/Documents/HURR BZ V1.numbers,
        - confirmed creation date of November 25, 2020 at 16:25,
        - uploaded to pre-git-hist/files/red to match events.tsv address,
        - updated output table 2,
11. as of 3 dec 2022 at 19.19 est, confirm that red/HURR BZ V1 *.tsv is earliest ancestral dataset of v-1.4, so (i think) it counts as version 0.0.0,
12. before continuing step 6, decide to transfer all data from pp.numbers as git doesn't seem to track diffs here,[^or there do seem to be tools to do this, but looks like a steep learning curve to continue with tsv files instead]
    - output to tsv 1 (log), tsv 2 (literature),
13. at 3 dec 2022 at 19.35 est, continue step 6 by building log in table 3 (log),
14. xx

## text 1

How to measure the selectivity and coverage of sources in historical literature? eg absence of newspapers, of Spanish primary records, etc.

As here were reviewing / commenting on literature, we'd like an exhaustive bibliography of said literature, possibly beginning with most recent? This would help demonstrate the rift between Spanish and non-Spanish sources. ie we'd like a graph of the literature.
