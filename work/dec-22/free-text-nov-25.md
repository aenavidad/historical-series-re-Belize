# log

1. we want to know what pre-1.4 versions of the data looked like, and ideally know a bit more about where those came from, and when,
    - so we skim pre-git-hist directory,
    - output to table 1
2. detour at 26 nov 2022 on 0.13 to skim stuff on semantic versioning as may be helpful here,
    - *semver* seems geared towards software, so we need something geared towards data,
    - skim [klump](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-012) for data-specific semantic versioning,
    - klump confirms no consensus best practice for versioning of data cf intro sec.,
    - klump = most recent [rda](https://www.rd-alliance.org/node/54345/outputs) output per intro sec.,
    - klump rules in *six data versioning principles* sec.,
    - stop detour on 1.46 to continue step 1,
