This distinction also makes it possible to systematize the release of different versions of the data.

Preserving the original text enables researchers to make a different interpretation. Data-transcription forms and data-entry software should include comment fields so that transcribers and data-entry operators have the opportunity to clarify their manual corrections.

In many cases, the terms which have been defined have also been assigned persistent identifiers. Such shared vocabularies can make it clear that we are talking about the same thing when we exchange knowledge."
