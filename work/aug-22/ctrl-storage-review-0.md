## abstract

review of rules and programmes used for version control and backup of data and files related to work.[^file created 17 aug 2022 20.41 in Boston MA]

## chronologically

### 1 oct 2020 to 8 aug 2022

- no version control nor backup

### 9 aug 2022 to present

- version control
    - `git` initialised for two remote repositories ie `aenavidad/pre-git-hist` and `aenavidad/historical-series-re-Belize`[^docs in [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/) and [github training](https://training.github.com/) and further see [github docs/workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).]
    - `git-lfs` initialised for one file type ie `tsv` within one remote repository ie `aenavidad/pre-git-hist`[^docs in [github git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com) inc [github git-lfs/wiki](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki).]

## tasks

- [ ] check session flow agrees with github flow,
- [ ] see how ot use osf via command line
- [ ] check lfs
- [x] blah

## addendum

have not answered question re
- version control vs backup ie archiving? diff?
- version control or backup for code vs for data?
- std lang for algorithms?

## further addendum

added 18 aug 2022 22.59

- let version control be implemented using `git` and `git-lfs`
- let backup be implemented using `github` and `osf`

above works well for small files ie below 100 MB, though we lose file-grained diffs for files above this threshhold.[^eg as per [OKF blog 2 july 2013](https://blog.okfn.org/2013/07/02/git-and-github-for-data/).]
