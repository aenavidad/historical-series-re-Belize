## further to-do

- variables ie data properties ie data relations need an index ie codebook ie dictionary preferably one with widespread adoption ie with URIs ie unique resource identifiers eg https://datos.bne.es/def/index-en.html and further eg https://id.loc.gov and further eg https://www.bl.uk/collection-metadata/strategy-and-standards
- data itself needs similar level of control but not sure how or where to begin for this
- classify sort of data series to be built eg graphical vs non per wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database
- browse through W3C standards eg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium#Standards and further eg re REF https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework
- read to do in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling
- read re data modelling https://www-sciencedirect-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/science/article/abs/pii/S1570826818300106?via%3Dihub

## graphs

- concept 0 - graph is set of vertices and edges eg in maths ie graph G = (vertices V, edges E) which may be fully specified by an adjacency matrix ie https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix
- concept 1 - graph is set of finite vertices and finite edges eg in computer science
