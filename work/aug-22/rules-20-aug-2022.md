# rules-20-aug-2022

## abstract

review of rules, processes, standards and the like for output of `v-1.5`[^file created 20 aug 2022 10.35 in Boston MA.]

note

- `pre-git-work` is processes, actions, events or the like during 1 oct 2020 to 8 aug 2022 giving as output `pre-git-files`
- `pre-git-files` are data or files in repo [pre-git-hist](https://github.com/aenavidad/pre-git-hist/) inc `v-1.4`[^where `v-1.4` is version 1.4 of data in any of the pre-git-hist repo or the historical-series-re-Belize repo or the osf repo or the harvard repo]
- `work` is processes, actions, events or the like during 9 aug 2022 to `null` giving as output `work-files`
- `work-files` are data or files in repo [historical-series-re-Belize](https://github.com/aenavidad/historical-series-re-Belize/) or in repo [Historical series regarding Belize](https://osf.io/7ujq5/) inc `v-1.5` and `pre-print`[^where `v-1.5` is version 1.5 of data and where `pre-print` is pre-print, manuscripts, and the like associated with `v-1.5`]

## work

start[^started 9 aug 2022 in Boston MA upon adoption of `git` for version-control.]

- [x] adopt git and git-lfs for version control,
- [x] adopt github and osf for backup storage,
- [x] backup `pre-git-files` in github and osf,
- [x] backup existing `work-files` in github and osf,
- [x] register `work` with osf,
- [x] review relevant standards for `work` or `work-files`,
- [x] adopt relevant standards for `work` or `work-files`,
- [ ] write `v-1.5`,
- [ ] write `pre-print`,
- [ ] verify standards compliance of `work` and `work-files`,
- [ ] pre-publish `v-1.5` and `pre-print`,

end

| COS TOP Guidelines | no 1 lvl iii | yes | `work-files` must appropriately cite[^ie must cite datasets and programme code used, where citation should (may) inc persistent identifier.] |
| COS TOP Guidelines | no 2 lvl ii[^lvl iii only possible via third-party action as requires publishing journal to verify replicability of `work`] | yes | `work-files` must be deposited in trusted repository[^where `work-files` must inc materials and methods (eg work log, work standards) and where `work-files` must be clearly and precisely documented and maximally available and where `work-files` must inc full account of how data collected, preprocessed, cleaned, and generated and where `work-files` must inc all materials and methods information necessary to independently replicate `work` and where parts of `work-files` which may not be shared (eg for legal or ethical reasons) must be noted in `work-files` inc explanation of restrictions and description of how to access restricted parts thereof.] |

| COS TOP Guidelines | no 6 lvl i[^lvl ii and lvl iii only possible via third-party action] | no[^as this project's work began in oct 2020, it isn't possible to pre-register it, though will be registered prior to pre-print.] | `work` must be pre-registered[^ie pre-registered in independent institutional registry.] |
| COS TOP Guidelines | no 7 lvl i | yes | data analysis plan ie steps to produce`v-1.5` must be pre-registered[^ie deposited in independent institutional registry. this is possible since version 1.4 data have not been cleaned nor analysed, so it's still possible to pre-register any plan for cleaning or processing of those data to produce `v-1.5`] |
