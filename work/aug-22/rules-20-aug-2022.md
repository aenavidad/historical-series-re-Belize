- `pre-git-files` are data or files in repo [pre-git-hist](https://github.com/aenavidad/pre-git-hist/) inc `v-1.4`[^where `v-1.4` is version 1.4 of data in any of the pre-git-hist repo or the historical-series-re-Belize repo or the osf repo or the harvard repo]
- `work` is processes, actions, events or the like during 9 aug 2022 to `null` giving as output `work-files`
- `work-files` are data or files in repo [historical-series-re-Belize](https://github.com/aenavidad/historical-series-re-Belize/) or in repo [Historical series regarding Belize](https://osf.io/7ujq5/) inc `v-1.5` and `pre-print`[^where `v-1.5` is version 1.5 of data and where `pre-print` is pre-print, manuscripts, and the like associated with `v-1.5`]

## work

start[^started 9 aug 2022 in Boston MA upon adoption of `git` for version-control.]

- [x] adopt git and git-lfs for version control,
- [x] adopt github and osf for backup storage,
- [x] backup `pre-git-files` in github and osf,
- [x] backup existing `work-files` in github and osf,
- [x] register `work` with osf,
- [x] review relevant standards for `work` or `work-files`,
- [x] adopt relevant standards for `work` or `work-files`,
- [ ] write `v-1.5`,
- [ ] write `pre-print`,
- [ ] verify standards compliance of `work` and `work-files`,
- [ ] pre-publish `v-1.5` and `pre-print`,

end

where to write `v-1.5`,

start

- [x] tag files in `pre-git-files` slated for data extraction,
- [ ] per tagged file, extract vertices, edges, d-function mapping and clean these and log all relevant decisions and details and write relevant csv and json files,
- [ ] validate all files written above,
- [ ] add with (clean) raw data,
- [ ] add generated data,
- [ ] transform into machine-readable format,
- [ ] transform into human-readable format,

end
