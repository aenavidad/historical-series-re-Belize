## log

1. [ ] ~~get preprint stuff from prev files,~~
    1. [ ] ~~in [[jun-23/out]],[^stop at 14.23 to jump to no 3 but ought to continue this step at some later point]~~
    2. [ ] ~~in [[may-23/readme]],~~[^seems to have been reviewed in jun-23]
    3. [ ] ~~in [[feb-23/readme]],~~[^seems to have been reviewed in jun-23]
2. [x] write initial working draft for preprint in [[draft0]],
3. [ ] ~~write draft0 s 5,~~
    1. [ ] ~~import content fm [[jun-23/out]],[^stop before 15.29 to jump to no 4 but ought to continue ofc]~~
4. [x] write draft0 s 4.1,
    1. [x] write draft table,
    2. [x] get controlled vocab to build table for s 4.1,
5. [x] write draft0 s 4.2,
6. [x] write draft0 s 5.1.1,
7. [x] write draft0 s 7.3,
    1. [x] fill in `v-1.4/versioning/statistics.tsv`,[^but completed work not crosschecked for errors nor omissions,and likely `events.tsv` similarly not crosschecked.]
    2. [x] check inclusion of named but null v 1.4 records in `v-1.4/versioning/*.tsv` files, as it seems these null records ought not to be counted for versioning?[^decided to include all named records, but to note them in tsv notes. further decided that rows with *only* empty but named records (ie row 4) ought to be versioned last or ignored in this initial pass.]
    3. [x] add missing info to s 7.3
8. [ ] xx
