## log

1. [ ] ~~get preprint stuff from prev files,~~
    1. [ ] ~~in [[jun-23/out]],[^stop at 14.23 to jump to no 3 but ought to continue this step at some later point]~~
    2. [ ] ~~in [[may-23/readme]],~~[^seems to have been reviewed in jun-23]
    3. [ ] ~~in [[feb-23/readme]],~~[^seems to have been reviewed in jun-23]
2. [x] write initial working draft for preprint in [[draft0]],
3. [ ] ~~write draft0 s 5,~~
    1. [ ] ~~import content fm [[jun-23/out]],[^stop before 15.29 to jump to no 4 but ought to continue ofc]~~
4. [x] write draft0 s 4.1,
    1. [x] write draft table,
    2. [x] get controlled vocab to build table for s 4.1,
5. [x] write draft0 s 4.2,
6. [x] write draft0 s 5.1.1,
7. [x] write draft0 s 7.3,
    1. [x] fill in `v-1.4/versioning/statistics.tsv`,[^but completed work not crosschecked for errors nor omissions,and likely `events.tsv` similarly not crosschecked.]
    2. [x] check inclusion of named but null v 1.4 records in `v-1.4/versioning/*.tsv` files, as it seems these null records ought not to be counted for versioning?[^decided to include all named records, but to note them in tsv notes. further decided that rows with *only* empty but named records (ie row 4) ought to be versioned last or ignored in this initial pass.]
    3. [x] add missing info to s 7.3
8. [x] try to present draft0 s 7.3 file-by-file logs in a single or couple tsv files,[^where the relevant logs are in `work/may-23/out1.md` s 'list source files' and in `work/dec-22/free-text-nov-25.md` s 'output' subs 3],
    1. [x] add all file records from `v-1.4/versioning/sheets varids.tsv` ie all those with varids,
    2. [x] add some file records from `pre-git-hist/sheets.tsv` ie all those *with* ids but *no* varids,
    3. [x] add some file records from `pre-git-hist/events.tsv` ie all those created pre-25 Nov 2020 *and* named in events.tsv,
    4. [x] for files with *id = 900, 902, 288, find all sources employed in their creation,[^where the listed files represent the earliest file on record, the earliest *tsv* file on record, and the earliest file *with* a varid]
    5. [x] for each source identified above, list a resolvable uri, and describe how it was found, and how it was handled,
    6. [x] for each piece of data output into files *id = 900, 902, provide its source, how the source was handled to arrive at the output, and the output location,
    7. [x] for each piece of data output into sheet 'Storms' file *id = 288, do as above,
    8. [x] list uncertainties, conventions, etc in notes,
    9. [x] output `draft0-s-7-files.tsv`, `draft0-s-7-sources.tsv`,`draft0-s-7-provenance.tsv`,
9. [ ] xx.
