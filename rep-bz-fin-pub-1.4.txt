Demas de dichos zambos mosquitos hay poblados como trescientos ingleses, segun el informe que me hicieron los prácticos de dicha costa, y que han estado entre ellos. Mas estas poblazones de ingleses estan muy apartadas y distantes del parage de los zambos mosquitos. Estan dichos ingleses en el parage que llaman Balis en esta costa de la mar del norte á el lado y costa del castillo del Golfo, que mira como quien navega para Campeachy. De suerte que saliendo del castillo del Golfo, y navegando costa á costa á los cuatro dias de navegacion se encuentra con las poblazones de Balis á la lengua del agua. Estos ingleses ha mucho tiempo que estan poblados y cortando palo de brasil, que el el fin y único ejercicio que tienen. Ellos cortan de este palo que superabunda en aquel parage, y gran parte de su circunferencia, por lo que mira á la montaña de dicha costa, y en porciones lo van vendiendo á otros ingleses, que á este fin vienen de Jamayca y de Inglaterra. En la montaña de dicho parage solo hay montes espesísimos y casi impenetrables; porque nunca jamas se ha oido hayan atravesado aquellas montañas por tierra, ni los ingleses á los pueblos ó haciendas de cathólicos por tierra adentro, ni los cathólicos al pueblo, parage de Balis. Todo esto débese entender de un tiempo posterior á la jornada del padre Delgado en adelante; pues en esa época aun habia camino por tierra de la Verapaz á Bacalar. Solo por mar, continúa diciendo el padre Castillo, en canóas ó por tierra, costa á costa, entre la lengua del agua y orilla de la montaña, han pasado algunos españoles y mulatos que han arribado á Balis, unos por temporal, otros que habiéndolos aprisionado en la mar, los han echado en Balis. Y las experiencias repetidas que hay del porte y proceder de estos ingleses de Balis, es que á cuantos cathólicos españoles han llegado allí, los han atendido y mirado bien. Y no solo no hacen daño, mas ha sucedido que habiendo un pirata echado en Balis á un español muy mal herido, los ingleses lo curaron y regalaron, y tambien lo aviaron de bastimentos, para que se volviese á su tierra. Y segun me informaron, dichos ingleses atienden mucho á los pobres españoles que llegan allí desrotados y necesitados, y los avían de lo necesario para irse á su tierra. Mas dichos ingleses nuncha jamas sales á pelear, ni hacer daño alguno, ni por mar ni por tierra, salvo cuando alguna vez, que ya ha sucedido, andan los mulatos y españoles á corso, y en llagando á Balis intentan quitarles sus balandras y piraguas, entónces sí se defienden y bien. Y solo á hurtadillas y descuidados les han cojido tal vez una ú otra balandra y uno ú otro hombre; pero si no les tocan á ellos, ellos no hacen mal alguno, ántes sí mucho bien. Y por lo que mira al palo que cortan, no es eso en perjuicio alguno de los nuestros, porque abundan mucho todas aquellas montañas desiertas, y los nuestros no se ocupan jamas en aquellos parages en tal ejercicio de cortar brasil. /v Garcia P 2 140–142"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

As they have no authority to try for life there, the fellow is confined on board the ship to take his trial on her arrival. /Virginia Gazette 939 2 = 18 May 1769 / See verbatim in New-York Journal 1378 1 = 1 Jun 1769 [Supplement] Link: https://infoweb-newsbank-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/apps/readex/doc?p=EANX&docref=image/v2%3A10DC31E31E090A88%40EANX-10DEEC83E5BA2460%402367326-10DEEC8400897B50%400-10DEEC84E634DA70%40Extract%2Bof%2Ba%2BLetter%2Bfrom%2Bthe%2BBay%2Bof%2BHonduras%252C%2BDated%2BDec.%2B12%252C%2B1768 /// See trial in New-York Gazette or Weekly Post-Boy 1377 2 = 22 May 1769 Link: https://infoweb-newsbank-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/apps/readex/doc?p=EANX&docref=image/v2%3A10D34AE6B0969558%40EANX-10DAB09E4906EDA8%402367316-10DAB09E940778D0%401-10DAB09F5FDA4430%40Charles-Town%252C%2B%2528South-Carolina%2529%2BMay%2B2 /// Possibly see, NEW-YORK, Aug 30 [1773].

En el reconocimiento de la costa y cayos de Barlovento [bw Old and Bahía de la Ascensión], hallé entre estos, pescando fuera de límites, muchos súbditos ingleses a quienes decomisé la pesca, devolviéndoles sus buques y muebles y permitiéndoles regresar a los establecimientos apercibidos, con arreglo a las órdenes de que serían tratados con rigor en lo sucesivo ... Como para fines de Frebrero debía haber en la boca del Walix un Comisario Británico que me acompañase a la visita anterior de los establecimientos, ... pero encontrándome sin el Comisario, me pasé a Cayo Frixol, distante 3 leguas de dicha Boca a esperarlo. En el Cayo encontré un pescador establecido con su familia, y habiéndole hecho ver, que estaba cometiendo una infracción lo evacuó ... me trasladé el 15-3 a la Boca del Walix para practicar las diligencias que debían preceder al reconocimiento, y el 17 me informaron los Magistrados, que entre los papeles de Mr. Lorenze Meygham, que había fallecido a principios del mismo mes, habían encontrado un pliego de mi General para el de Jam, ... La operación de reconocer los huertas me proporcionó el ver perfectamente los establecimientos. En lo interior de ellos, no noté trangresión alguno de los que se recomiendan como graves en el Tratado ... y Convención ... Esto es obra de defensa u otras militares de artillería, o tropa, pero sí excesos en el cultivo, ... pero es de advertir, que dichos excesos son bastante depreciables para el que las vea; porque las huertas tan pretendidas no son otra cosa en lo general, que unos plantales, muchos de ellos mal cuidados, que tienen por objeto, no la delicadeza, sino el ahorro de víveres para los negros, pues no ví ni aun una lechuga en todos los establecimientos; bien que no por esto dejé de explicarme como debía, acerca de excederse en cuanto al terreno, y en lo tocante a las plantas de cultivo, considerando que cuando se tolera y disimula lo poco, lleguen los abusos a lo sumo; ... mi correspondencia con los Magistrados, aunque siempre los nombré con este título, fué solamente como unos sujetos particulares visibles; ... tuve el designio de no consentir en el sistema de policía que observan, por ser materia dudosa, aun entre ellos ... si S.M.B. puede, sin la anuencia de nuestro Soberano, disponer la observancia de dicho sistema ... En nlas riberas extra límites del Valis, su brazo y los esteros Black Crek y Spanish Crek, noté muchos y graves infracciones. Estas fueron el cultivo de varios pedazos de terreno, una considerable porción estraída de palo de Campeachy y de mora, y como 700 árboles de caoba cortados, y sacados ... De éstos y de la cantidad de caoba extraída, no hubiera yo podido instruirme con toda exactitud, si no me hubiera auxiliado a ellos las noticias de habitantes fidedignos, las cuales no me fué difícil adquirir, porque el común de los habitantes detesta semejantes infracciones, y anhela el verlas remediadas, por lo que le dañan, haciendo descender el precio de la caoba con la excesiva abundancia a la mitad de lo que generalmente se considera necesario para que la corta sea útil a los cortadores. ... Los más de los pescadores de los establecimientos; hacen la pesca, especialmente la de la tortuga fuera de límites; entre los cayos que están al sur de los mismos establecimientos, y uno, y otro he oído que van a las islas inmediatas al Cabo Catoche ... No hay, como he dicho, en los establecimientos, obra alguno de defensa, ni el menos preparativo militar, pues de dos casas fuertes, que cuando yo salí para la visita, aún se dudaba si existían en la Boca de Jalova, no había en ésta ni señales de donde estuvieron, pero me hallo bien enterado de que el Oficial a quien se comisionó, para examinar el estado de las costas durante los últimos recelos de rompimiento, no padeció ni la más level equivocación en cuanto informó tocante a obras, a ejercicios militares, que quiso desfigurar el Sup Hunter; ... hay 9 Magistrados, de que bastan 3 para formar un cuerpo; transan las desavenencias civiles que ocurren entre los habitantes, y juzgan los delitos cometidos dentro de los límites, con autoridad de condenar a muerte, y hacer ejecutar la pena, fundando sus sentencias sobre las leyes generales de Inglaterra. Su oficio es anual, y se eligen los nuevos a principios de Mayo. Hay también otro cuerpo político que se titula el Gran Jury, y se compone de 12 habitantes juramentados cuya obligación es representar a los Magistrados en Juntas Generales, que se celebran cada 3 meses, todo lo que es necesario a favor del común.

It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community.

The great bulk of the Lower Classes, however, and almost all the Charibs and Spaniards who resort to the Settlement, are employed in the Mah Works in the Interior, and with them it is the practice to enter into Contract by which they hire themselves generally for six or twelve months. This is usually done at the commencement or middle of the year, when the servant goes before a Mag, & volunteers a Contract for his services. It is the enforcement of these Contracts, however, that the great evil lies. There is no law on the subject further than what custom has sanctioned. That custom has been, that where the Servant has failed in his Contract, the Master has had the power to bring him up at once on Warrant, and have him summarily punished by Imprisonment and public Whipping. If however the breach of Contract lay with the Master,—If for example, the Master was deficient in the payments he had contract to make his servant, the Servant could only sue the Master as in the matter of a common debt. To send the Servant into Court for hte recovery of his wages amounts to an absolute denial of justice to him. People in his condition are not supposed to possess the means of their remaining for months at Belize to prosecute thier suits for those very earnings which would enable them to reside there for alittle.

That misguided individual, the Freebooter General Walker, had at length run into the lion's mouth and found the fate he had so richly deserved. The last record of him may be worth preserving in our annals. A reward of two thousand dollars had been offered for his capture. H.M.S. *Icarus*, Commander N. Salmon, with a transport of troops under the command of Alvarez, had proceeded to Rio Negro, where Walker and his band had encamped. The boats of the *Icarus* passed up the river, captured Walker and seventy of his men, all of whom had been taken back to Truxillo, and given up to the authorities of [Sp] Honduras. Many of the men being sick, were permitted to return to the United States, on condition of never again engaging in an expedition against Central America. As for Walker and one of his colonerls, named Kudler, they were to be shot. And thus the freebooter met his fate. Being condemned, but with difficulty saved from popular fury, in his six days of imprisonment he had ample time for thought, and conscience smote him on contemplating his prison, and also on seeing the people that he had defeated and driven from their homes on the 6th of August [1860?] treating him with the greatest benevolence and kindness. Carried to the place of death and being ready to be executed, he begged leave to address the people in these few words:—""I declare myself to be a member of the Roman Catholic church. I declare that I have injured the people of [Sp] Honduras to a great extent, being led to do so by the people of the island of Ruatan, who, after calling me, deceived me and left me to my fate. I ask pardon for the poor men that accompanied me, for they are not so guilty as I am. If my life can be of any benefit to society I lay it down with the greatest readiness, pardoning my judges, that I may be enabled to obtain my pardon in the next world."" These were his last words, and with these the scene closed; it being worthy of notice that although the port of Truxillo was attacked ruthlessly by him, yet the people of the town pitied him, and in the whole crown there was not one glad countenance. /Naut Mag 1860 605–606 Link: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066364856?urlappend=%3Bseq=613%3Bownerid=13510798882112364-669 /// See Regis A.

Quiero a Guat, pero quiero más a Belice. Los ingleses ya se han enterado por su servicio de Inteliencia, de estas pláticas. Están rápidamente trabajando para contraarrestarlas. Les advierto a ustedes que si no se apuran a tomar una decisión definitiva, y los ingleses entretanto, me hacen una proposición definitiva, y los ingleses entretanto, me hacen una proposición tan buena o mejor que la de Guat, y más rápida para ponerla en práctica, yo los abandono a ustedes, y me paso con mi partido al lado de Inglaterra."" ... Teníamos, pues, que movernos y ganar la carrera a los ingleses. /Idigoras 15–16 /// 24 Nov 1953 Lon.

As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jam and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeachy, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /Read’s Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer 375 3 /// Possibly see [Dec 1730 Puerto Caballos] La [Gazeta de Guat] de diciembre del año de [1]730, en el artículo Comayagua, dice: las cartas de esta ciudad participan, que á los últimos de octubre y principios de noviembre, dos armadores de corso, de los que se hallan en Puerto Caballos, apresaron dos balandras inglesas, de las que comercian en el rio de Balis, la una cargada de vino, aguardiente, carnes, harina y algunos lienzos, y la otra con alguna aguardiente y un negro. / [1730 Old R] Murillo [Pedro Murillo Velarde y Bravo, 1696–1753] lib. 9 cap 3, hablando del establecimiento de ingleses en Yucatan, escribe.

The Spaniards then removed the crew and register mone first to St. George's Key and thence to Bacalar, leaving Mr. John Lockhart Smith (a naval Lieutenant and a Bayman) in charge of the frigate and cargo. After the Spaniards had gone, several Bay vessels full of indigo arrived at the Key from the wreck, and letters from the Commandant at Bacalar inquiring about the cargo were not attended to. The Baymen proposed to confiscate the whole of it and when Ferrals remonstrated they threatened his life. The Frigate [Thetis], which lay high and dry was unnecessarily burnt. ""Sworn before me ...""

S. Enys] NAUTICAL RAMBLES.—THE LEEWARD STATION DURING THE WAR. *Port Royal and its Association*. SEVERAL gallant actions on a *small scale* were performed on the station, which on that account were cast into the shade, and soon forgotten among the many brilliant achievements elsewhere. We may, perhaps, be permitted the pleasure of briefly mentioning some of these, as being creditable tot he performers, and honourable to the country. Midshipman Bowler of H.M.S. *Swift*, of 16 guns, Captain Wright, was serving *pro. tem.* with Lieut. Smith, in a tender schooner, called the *Mary Ann*. This vessel was sent to cruize off Truxillo, (the Swift being stationed at Honduas,) for the purpose of intercepting a privateer, which had captured the Colonial schooner, *Admiral Duckworth*. It was desirable to look into the above-named Spanish Port to determine whether the vessel they were in quest of had sailed, or was still in harbour. For this purpose two small boats were manned and armed, one under the charge of Boatswain Walker, and the other commanded by the Mid named, who had with him only four lads, the whole, including the officer, being under *eighteen years of age!* What could be expected of such striplings? We shall see presently how they acquitted themselves. After night-fall the boats shoved off, at some distance from the port, for the understood object of reconnoitring; for nothing more could be expected from such slender means. When they had come near enough to make out the vessels, the boats separated; the boatswain having directions to pull in shore and examine the craft lying nearest the town; and the Mid those which were anchored further out. In the exceeding these orders, the latters officer being deceived by the darkness, found himself close to a large armed schooner, and it became sufficiently evident to him, from the noise and bustle on board of her, that the boat was discovered. There was no time for deliberation; whatever was to be done, must be performed with promptitude, the youthful officer determined with the characteristic readiness of his profession, to take the bull by the horns."" Directing the lads to give way, and boat the oars, he was soon alongside, and was saluted with a discharge from one of the guns of the schooner, the shot from which shattered their little boat, which sunk under them! Here was a crisis falling like a thunder-bolt upon them at the onset; retreat, had they understood the force of the term, of the caution which the unusual energy of the Dons intended they should understand by the bright flash, and the rattling sound and effect that followed, was out of the quesiton. But one *ultimo ratio* remained, it was that which our tars liked best; and, in a second it was embraced, and the gallant *five* were, strong in that indomitable spirit belonging to the boys of the ocean isle, engaged hand to hand on the schooner's deck with nearly *four times* their number of athletic marineros. The business, however, was soon settled in the usual fashion, and the Spaniards who survived, driven below; the sails loosed, and set, the cable cut, and the fine craft standing out! The capture proved to be the privateer, Coridad Perfecta, coppered, and pierced for sixteen guns, but mounting twelve; and having on board at the time, fifteen men; the rest of the crew being on shore. We perceive now, whatever may have been expected, how these five lads performed their duty; and I think it will be admitted that, although very many daring acts of gallantry were achieved during the war, few surpassed this for promptitude and intrepidity, by actors so young. /Naut Mag 1844 452–453 Link: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066363874?urlappend=%3Bseq=482%3Bownerid=13510798882112430-516"""	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D.

It was captured fm the Indians on 2d of Jul 1849, by a force of 800 men, consisting in part of American volunteers, at the expense of many lives, in consequence of large number of Indians in town (some three or four thousand), though majority of them were unarmed. Shortly after taking of Bac a Yucateco officer was captured, who had deserted to the Indians. He was pardoned, ordered into service again, and despatched with a party of men to reconnoitre the sea coast. Instead of that, however, he proceeded to an Eng village near Belize, Hon, murdered some of the inhabitants and plundered the place. The Eng Gov of Belize immediately sent word to the commander at Bac of this affair, who caused the offender, named Pacheco, to be sent for by a large force, and he was shot on his arrival, in presence of the Eng messenger.

Then followed the conviction of two fo the parties who had conspired to burn this town, to murder and rob some of our citizens, and the severe sentence of the convicts, of imprisonment at hard labor for ten years, and to be publicly whipped through the town once in each six months during the term. /New York Herald 23 320 3 = 18 Nov 1858 [Morn Ed]"	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

The commencement of the year 1859 was remarkable for the uneasiness and apprehension which pervaded the whole community, and originated in the recent failures of two extensive Houses engaged in the Mah Trade. The calamitous consequences of these commercial disaster were widely diffused, and injuriously afflicted every branch of our local industry ... the Mah Trade has been entirely engrossed by four or five influential Firms, who employ lg numbers of Foremen, Laborers, and Mechanics in their different Works ... the retail Stores have always mainly depended for their annual profits upon the sums disbursed by the Gangs, when they return to Belize in the month of Dec, for the purpose of entering into fresh Contracts for the ensuing Season ... The natural result followed the reverses ... The operations of the embarrassed Houses were restricted. The Labor Market became crowded with Persons seeking employment, and the price of Labor fell—It is true that the few who could command Capital were enabled to hire their Workmen at a remunerative rate—but, as the usual amount of money was not in circulation, the Shopkeepers suffered in proportion, and failed to realize their customary emoluments. Another Interest was also languishing and depressed—Those Merchants, who imported with a view to rpincipally disposing of their Goods to Purchasers fm the contiguous States of CA, had found that modern facilities of communication with Europe had gradually induced many Foreigners to resort directly to the home manufacturers for their supplies, instead of dealin as heretofore with their Correspondents in Belize—and thus, simultaneously, all Classes looked forward with a gloomy foreboding, and distrust of the future. /R 66 /v Bolland F 177–178 /// 1870 Major landholders = Young, Toledo & Co; Sheldon Byass & Co; John Carmichael; Brit Hon Co /v Ashdown 22"	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jam and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeachy, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /Read’s Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer 375 3 /// Possibly see [Dec 1730 Puerto Caballos] La [Gazeta de Guat] de diciembre del año de [1]730, en el artículo Comayagua, dice: las cartas de esta ciudad participan, que á los últimos de octubre y principios de noviembre, dos armadores de corso, de los que se hallan en Puerto Caballos, apresaron dos balandras inglesas, de las que comercian en el rio de Balis, la una cargada de vino, aguardiente, carnes, harina y algunos lienzos, y la otra con alguna aguardiente y un negro. / [1730 Old R] Murillo [Pedro Murillo Velarde y Bravo, 1696–1753] lib. 9 cap 3, hablando del establecimiento de ingleses en Yucatan, escribe.

S. Enys] NAUTICAL RAMBLES.—THE LEEWARD STATION DURING THE WAR. *Port Royal and its Association*. SEVERAL gallant actions on a *small scale* were performed on the station, which on that account were cast into the shade, and soon forgotten among the many brilliant achievements elsewhere. We may, perhaps, be permitted the pleasure of briefly mentioning some of these, as being creditable tot he performers, and honourable to the country. Midshipman Bowler of H.M.S. *Swift*, of 16 guns, Captain Wright, was serving *pro. tem.* with Lieut. Smith, in a tender schooner, called the *Mary Ann*. This vessel was sent to cruize off Truxillo, (the Swift being stationed at Honduas,) for the purpose of intercepting a privateer, which had captured the Colonial schooner, *Admiral Duckworth*. It was desirable to look into the above-named Spanish Port to determine whether the vessel they were in quest of had sailed, or was still in harbour. For this purpose two small boats were manned and armed, one under the charge of Boatswain Walker, and the other commanded by the Mid named, who had with him only four lads, the whole, including the officer, being under *eighteen years of age!* What could be expected of such striplings? We shall see presently how they acquitted themselves. After night-fall the boats shoved off, at some distance from the port, for the understood object of reconnoitring; for nothing more could be expected from such slender means. When they had come near enough to make out the vessels, the boats separated; the boatswain having directions to pull in shore and examine the craft lying nearest the town; and the Mid those which were anchored further out. In the exceeding these orders, the latters officer being deceived by the darkness, found himself close to a large armed schooner, and it became sufficiently evident to him, from the noise and bustle on board of her, that the boat was discovered. There was no time for deliberation; whatever was to be done, must be performed with promptitude, the youthful officer determined with the characteristic readiness of his profession, to take the bull by the horns."" Directing the lads to give way, and boat the oars, he was soon alongside, and was saluted with a discharge from one of the guns of the schooner, the shot from which shattered their little boat, which sunk under them! Here was a crisis falling like a thunder-bolt upon them at the onset; retreat, had they understood the force of the term, of the caution which the unusual energy of the Dons intended they should understand by the bright flash, and the rattling sound and effect that followed, was out of the quesiton. But one *ultimo ratio* remained, it was that which our tars liked best; and, in a second it was embraced, and the gallant *five* were, strong in that indomitable spirit belonging to the boys of the ocean isle, engaged hand to hand on the schooner's deck with nearly *four times* their number of athletic marineros. The business, however, was soon settled in the usual fashion, and the Spaniards who survived, driven below; the sails loosed, and set, the cable cut, and the fine craft standing out! The capture proved to be the privateer, Coridad Perfecta, coppered, and pierced for sixteen guns, but mounting twelve; and having on board at the time, fifteen men; the rest of the crew being on shore. We perceive now, whatever may have been expected, how these five lads performed their duty; and I think it will be admitted that, although very many daring acts of gallantry were achieved during the war, few surpassed this for promptitude and intrepidity, by actors so young. /Naut Mag 1844 452–453 Link: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066363874?urlappend=%3Bseq=482%3Bownerid=13510798882112430-516"""	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

En este presidio todo el tiempo de la guerra hubo lo ménos triplicado número de tropas que en ese establecimiento, una lancha con un cañon de á 24, un ponton con uno de á 18, todas las piraguas armadas, y se hacian preparativos para una expedicion con fuerzas navales que debian venir de Campeachy, y continuamente una piragua bien guarnecida y con artillería de guarda-costa, cruzando hasta mas de las puntas de Piedra y Calentura, y la misma subia por Rio Nuevo á la laguna del Tipú para reconocer sus crillas y particularmente el istmo que media entre el extremo de esta y el estero español ó *Spanish Creek*, habiendo sido el capitan D. .Manuel Melendez quien practicó esta diligencia al concluirse la guerra: de aquí inferirá V.S. que ningun cortador habia de incurrir en la temeridad de venir á Rio Nuevo con la seguridad de ser hecho prisionero; ... se me dió parte en Octubre [1810] de que se habian visto en la vigía de San Antonio dos ó tres botes: mandé al subteniente D. José Luis Melendez á hacer un reconocimento en Rio-Nuevo, lo subió y no halló huellas ni aun ramas cortadas, ni la menor señal de haber entrado hombres en él, y esto lo corrobora el que los ranchos encontrados por el capitan Melendez en Febrero último [1812], se componian de chozas pequeñísimas y muy nuevas, ... si V.S. pide informer hallará que todos han graduado allá de fraudulentos los cortes de los caballeros Hyde, y Bennet y otro, pues es punto que judicialmente se examinó y decidió en junta de magistrados por Julio del año pasado [1811]. ... En suma, los colonos Hyde y Bennet animados de su caudal, y el mulato Armstrong porque sirve á estos, se han hecho dueños de todo el rio [Nuevo], hasta el extremo de haber abusado del candor y buena fé de V.S. moviéndole con engaños á una providencia hostil de que despues trataré. Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D.

Shortly after taking of Bac a Yucateco officer was captured, who had deserted to the Indians. He was pardoned, ordered into service again, and despatched with a party of men to reconnoitre the sea coast. Instead of that, however, he proceeded to an Eng village near Belize, Hon, murdered some of the inhabitants and plundered the place.

The natural result followed the reverses ... The operations of the embarrassed Houses were restricted. The Labor Market became crowded with Persons seeking employment, and the price of Labor fell—It is true that the few who could command Capital were enabled to hire their Workmen at a remunerative rate—but, as the usual amount of money was not in circulation, the Shopkeepers suffered in proportion, and failed to realize their customary emoluments. Another Interest was also languishing and depressed—Those Merchants, who imported with a view to rpincipally disposing of their Goods to Purchasers fm the contiguous States of CA, had found that modern facilities of communication with Europe had gradually induced many Foreigners to resort directly to the home manufacturers for their supplies, instead of dealin as heretofore with their Correspondents in Belize—and thus, simultaneously, all Classes looked forward with a gloomy foreboding, and distrust of the future. /R 66 /v Bolland F 177–178 /// 1870 Major landholders = Young, Toledo & Co; Sheldon Byass & Co; John Carmichael; Brit Hon Co /v Ashdown 22"	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

After talking with these chiefs, he says, don't you come over the line into my colony under any pretensions whatever; If any of your people commit any crime against your laws, and comes over into Eng territory, don't you come after him, nor send pursuers to take him away, fi you do I will imprison every man I find engaged in such acts; you must report your case to me, and I will have him arrested and handed over to you, and, if any or our people escape into your territory, you must arrest them and send them back, as I agree to do to you; now no violation of this agreement, if you do I shall chastise you, all right; good faith has been kept, and peace and quiet universally has prevailed.
