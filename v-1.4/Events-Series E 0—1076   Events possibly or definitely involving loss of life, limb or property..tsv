Whereupon the Mate and his Company consented, and Barlow delivered one of his Pistols to Perry the Mate, who taking an Opportunity in teh Steergate, presented his Pistol at one of the Pirates, and snapt, so was oblig'd to retreat; the Pirate having 4 Pistols about him, immediately presented one at Perry, which likewise snapt.

The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jam and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeachy, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /Read’s Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer 375 3 /// Possibly see [Dec 1730 Puerto Caballos] La [Gazeta de Guat] de diciembre del año de [1]730, en el artículo Comayagua, dice: las cartas de esta ciudad participan, que á los últimos de octubre y principios de noviembre, dos armadores de corso, de los que se hallan en Puerto Caballos, apresaron dos balandras inglesas, de las que comercian en el rio de Balis, la una cargada de vino, aguardiente, carnes, harina y algunos lienzos, y la otra con alguna aguardiente y un negro. / [1730 Old R] Murillo [Pedro Murillo Velarde y Bravo, 1696–1753] lib. 9 cap 3, hablando del establecimiento de ingleses en Yucatan, escribe.

By these aggressions, more than five hundred settlers were driven from their habitations, with the loss of their property, amounting to above £27,000 sterling. /v Coxe 4 316 /Add MS xxx [= mss entitled *Remarks on the article of the treaty of 1763, relating to the settlements in the bay of Mexico, by a british settler* in Lord Auckland’s Collection] /// See CO 5/119 Part 1 Link: http://www.colonialamerica.amdigital.co.uk.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/Documents/Details/CO_5_119_Part_1_012 /// REMIREZ DE ESTENOZ A ARRIAGA, EN MERIDA A 12-3-764. ...

S. Enys] NAUTICAL RAMBLES.—THE LEEWARD STATION DURING THE WAR. *Port Royal and its Association*. SEVERAL gallant actions on a *small scale* were performed on the station, which on that account were cast into the shade, and soon forgotten among the many brilliant achievements elsewhere. We may, perhaps, be permitted the pleasure of briefly mentioning some of these, as being creditable tot he performers, and honourable to the country. Midshipman Bowler of H.M.S. *Swift*, of 16 guns, Captain Wright, was serving *pro. tem.* with Lieut. Smith, in a tender schooner, called the *Mary Ann*. This vessel was sent to cruize off Truxillo, (the Swift being stationed at Honduas,) for the purpose of intercepting a privateer, which had captured the Colonial schooner, *Admiral Duckworth*. It was desirable to look into the above-named Spanish Port to determine whether the vessel they were in quest of had sailed, or was still in harbour. For this purpose two small boats were manned and armed, one under the charge of Boatswain Walker, and the other commanded by the Mid named, who had with him only four lads, the whole, including the officer, being under *eighteen years of age!* What could be expected of such striplings? We shall see presently how they acquitted themselves. After night-fall the boats shoved off, at some distance from the port, for the understood object of reconnoitring; for nothing more could be expected from such slender means. When they had come near enough to make out the vessels, the boats separated; the boatswain having directions to pull in shore and examine the craft lying nearest the town; and the Mid those which were anchored further out. In the exceeding these orders, the latters officer being deceived by the darkness, found himself close to a large armed schooner, and it became sufficiently evident to him, from the noise and bustle on board of her, that the boat was discovered. There was no time for deliberation; whatever was to be done, must be performed with promptitude, the youthful officer determined with the characteristic readiness of his profession, to take the bull by the horns."" Directing the lads to give way, and boat the oars, he was soon alongside, and was saluted with a discharge from one of the guns of the schooner, the shot from which shattered their little boat, which sunk under them! Here was a crisis falling like a thunder-bolt upon them at the onset; retreat, had they understood the force of the term, of the caution which the unusual energy of the Dons intended they should understand by the bright flash, and the rattling sound and effect that followed, was out of the quesiton. But one *ultimo ratio* remained, it was that which our tars liked best; and, in a second it was embraced, and the gallant *five* were, strong in that indomitable spirit belonging to the boys of the ocean isle, engaged hand to hand on the schooner's deck with nearly *four times* their number of athletic marineros. The business, however, was soon settled in the usual fashion, and the Spaniards who survived, driven below; the sails loosed, and set, the cable cut, and the fine craft standing out! The capture proved to be the privateer, Coridad Perfecta, coppered, and pierced for sixteen guns, but mounting twelve; and having on board at the time, fifteen men; the rest of the crew being on shore. We perceive now, whatever may have been expected, how these five lads performed their duty; and I think it will be admitted that, although very many daring acts of gallantry were achieved during the war, few surpassed this for promptitude and intrepidity, by actors so young. /Naut Mag 1844 452–453 Link: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066363874?urlappend=%3Bseq=482%3Bownerid=13510798882112430-516"""	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

Ni los capitanes generales de Yucatan, ni los gobernadores de Bacalar desde que una declaracion de guerra abolió el tratado de paz de 1783 y convencion de 86, han creido que los súbditos británicos pudieran extenderse hasta dentro de dichas puntas: y la correspondencia que medió entre la capitanía general y esa superintendencia, despues del tratado de paz de Amiens, fué extendida en este concepto; sin que á él se oponga el que algunos con precaucion para no ser vistos de la vigía de San Antonio, hayan venido á dicho Rio Nuevo; y tengo una reciente prueba de que ellos mismos han graduado de ilícita su conducta, y es la de que el Sr. Wade, en papel que envió para mí con fecha 2 del corriente, no expresó el lugar donde estaba ni el cabo destacado en dicho vigía: por mas que preguntó á los conductores de dónde venian, consiguió descubrir la verdad, pues le dijeron que del Walix, hallándose Wade en la laguna del Tipú, ... /v Peniche 383 /xxx /// Gual a Smyth, Bacalar a 7 agosto 1812.

En este presidio todo el tiempo de la guerra hubo lo ménos triplicado número de tropas que en ese establecimiento, una lancha con un cañon de á 24, un ponton con uno de á 18, todas las piraguas armadas, y se hacian preparativos para una expedicion con fuerzas navales que debian venir de Campeachy, y continuamente una piragua bien guarnecida y con artillería de guarda-costa, cruzando hasta mas de las puntas de Piedra y Calentura, y la misma subia por Rio Nuevo á la laguna del Tipú para reconocer sus crillas y particularmente el istmo que media entre el extremo de esta y el estero español ó *Spanish Creek*, habiendo sido el capitan D. .Manuel Melendez quien practicó esta diligencia al concluirse la guerra: de aquí inferirá V.S. que ningun cortador habia de incurrir en la temeridad de venir á Rio Nuevo con la seguridad de ser hecho prisionero; ... se me dió parte en Octubre [1810] de que se habian visto en la vigía de San Antonio dos ó tres botes: mandé al subteniente D. José Luis Melendez á hacer un reconocimento en Rio-Nuevo, lo subió y no halló huellas ni aun ramas cortadas, ni la menor señal de haber entrado hombres en él, y esto lo corrobora el que los ranchos encontrados por el capitan Melendez en Febrero último [1812], se componian de chozas pequeñísimas y muy nuevas, ... si V.S. pide informer hallará que todos han graduado allá de fraudulentos los cortes de los caballeros Hyde, y Bennet y otro, pues es punto que judicialmente se examinó y decidió en junta de magistrados por Julio del año pasado [1811]. ... En suma, los colonos Hyde y Bennet animados de su caudal, y el mulato Armstrong porque sirve á estos, se han hecho dueños de todo el rio [Nuevo], hasta el extremo de haber abusado del candor y buena fé de V.S. moviéndole con engaños á una providencia hostil de que despues trataré. Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D.

He was pardoned, ordered into service again, and despatched with a party of men to reconnoitre the sea coast. Instead of that, however, he proceeded to an Eng village near Belize, Hon, murdered some of the inhabitants and plundered the place.

The natural result followed the reverses ... The operations of the embarrassed Houses were restricted. The Labor Market became crowded with Persons seeking employment, and the price of Labor fell—It is true that the few who could command Capital were enabled to hire their Workmen at a remunerative rate—but, as the usual amount of money was not in circulation, the Shopkeepers suffered in proportion, and failed to realize their customary emoluments. Another Interest was also languishing and depressed—Those Merchants, who imported with a view to rpincipally disposing of their Goods to Purchasers fm the contiguous States of CA, had found that modern facilities of communication with Europe had gradually induced many Foreigners to resort directly to the home manufacturers for their supplies, instead of dealin as heretofore with their Correspondents in Belize—and thus, simultaneously, all Classes looked forward with a gloomy foreboding, and distrust of the future. /R 66 /v Bolland F 177–178 /// 1870 Major landholders = Young, Toledo & Co; Sheldon Byass & Co; John Carmichael; Brit Hon Co /v Ashdown 22"	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	xnp	###

After talking with these chiefs, he says, don't you come over the line into my colony under any pretensions whatever; If any of your people commit any crime against your laws, and comes over into Eng territory, don't you come after him, nor send pursuers to take him away, fi you do I will imprison every man I find engaged in such acts; you must report your case to me, and I will have him arrested and handed over to you, and, if any or our people escape into your territory, you must arrest them and send them back, as I agree to do to you; now no violation of this agreement, if you do I shall chastise you, all right; good faith has been kept, and peace and quiet universally has prevailed.
