Demas de dichos zambos mosquitos hay poblados como trescientos ingleses, segun el informe que me hicieron los prácticos de dicha costa, y que han estado entre ellos. Mas estas poblazones de ingleses estan muy apartadas y distantes del parage de los zambos mosquitos. Estan dichos ingleses en el parage que llaman Balis en esta costa de la mar del norte á el lado y costa del castillo del Golfo, que mira como quien navega para Campeachy. De suerte que saliendo del castillo del Golfo, y navegando costa á costa á los cuatro dias de navegacion se encuentra con las poblazones de Balis á la lengua del agua. Estos ingleses ha mucho tiempo que estan poblados y cortando palo de brasil, que el el fin y único ejercicio que tienen. Ellos cortan de este palo que superabunda en aquel parage, y gran parte de su circunferencia, por lo que mira á la montaña de dicha costa, y en porciones lo van vendiendo á otros ingleses, que á este fin vienen de Jamayca y de Inglaterra. En la montaña de dicho parage solo hay montes espesísimos y casi impenetrables; porque nunca jamas se ha oido hayan atravesado aquellas montañas por tierra, ni los ingleses á los pueblos ó haciendas de cathólicos por tierra adentro, ni los cathólicos al pueblo, parage de Balis. Todo esto débese entender de un tiempo posterior á la jornada del padre Delgado en adelante; pues en esa época aun habia camino por tierra de la Verapaz á Bacalar. Solo por mar, continúa diciendo el padre Castillo, en canóas ó por tierra, costa á costa, entre la lengua del agua y orilla de la montaña, han pasado algunos españoles y mulatos que han arribado á Balis, unos por temporal, otros que habiéndolos aprisionado en la mar, los han echado en Balis. Y las experiencias repetidas que hay del porte y proceder de estos ingleses de Balis, es que á cuantos cathólicos españoles han llegado allí, los han atendido y mirado bien. Y no solo no hacen daño, mas ha sucedido que habiendo un pirata echado en Balis á un español muy mal herido, los ingleses lo curaron y regalaron, y tambien lo aviaron de bastimentos, para que se volviese á su tierra. Y segun me informaron, dichos ingleses atienden mucho á los pobres españoles que llegan allí desrotados y necesitados, y los avían de lo necesario para irse á su tierra. Mas dichos ingleses nuncha jamas sales á pelear, ni hacer daño alguno, ni por mar ni por tierra, salvo cuando alguna vez, que ya ha sucedido, andan los mulatos y españoles á corso, y en llagando á Balis intentan quitarles sus balandras y piraguas, entónces sí se defienden y bien. Y solo á hurtadillas y descuidados les han cojido tal vez una ú otra balandra y uno ú otro hombre; pero si no les tocan á ellos, ellos no hacen mal alguno, ántes sí mucho bien. Y por lo que mira al palo que cortan, no es eso en perjuicio alguno de los nuestros, porque abundan mucho todas aquellas montañas desiertas, y los nuestros no se ocupan jamas en aquellos parages en tal ejercicio de cortar brasil. /v Garcia P 2 140–142"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

Estas fueron el cultivo de varios pedazos de terreno, una considerable porción estraída de palo de Campeachy y de mora, y como 700 árboles de caoba cortados, y sacados ... De éstos y de la cantidad de caoba extraída, no hubiera yo podido instruirme con toda exactitud, si no me hubiera auxiliado a ellos las noticias de habitantes fidedignos, las cuales no me fué difícil adquirir, porque el común de los habitantes detesta semejantes infracciones, y anhela el verlas remediadas, por lo que le dañan, haciendo descender el precio de la caoba con la excesiva abundancia a la mitad de lo que generalmente se considera necesario para que la corta sea útil a los cortadores. ... Los más de los pescadores de los establecimientos; hacen la pesca, especialmente la de la tortuga fuera de límites; entre los cayos que están al sur de los mismos establecimientos, y uno, y otro he oído que van a las islas inmediatas al Cabo Catoche ... No hay, como he dicho, en los establecimientos, obra alguno de defensa, ni el menos preparativo militar, pues de dos casas fuertes, que cuando yo salí para la visita, aún se dudaba si existían en la Boca de Jalova, no había en ésta ni señales de donde estuvieron, pero me hallo bien enterado de que el Oficial a quien se comisionó, para examinar el estado de las costas durante los últimos recelos de rompimiento, no padeció ni la más level equivocación en cuanto informó tocante a obras, a ejercicios militares, que quiso desfigurar el Sup Hunter; ... hay 9 Magistrados, de que bastan 3 para formar un cuerpo; transan las desavenencias civiles que ocurren entre los habitantes, y juzgan los delitos cometidos dentro de los límites, con autoridad de condenar a muerte, y hacer ejecutar la pena, fundando sus sentencias sobre las leyes generales de Inglaterra. Su oficio es anual, y se eligen los nuevos a principios de Mayo. Hay también otro cuerpo político que se titula el Gran Jury, y se compone de 12 habitantes juramentados cuya obligación es representar a los Magistrados en Juntas Generales, que se celebran cada 3 meses, todo lo que es necesario a favor del común. Así me explicó un Magistrado, persona de talento y verdad, dicho sistema. No hay Superintendente, ni esperan que la haya; .. /v Calderon 389 /MEXICO,3025"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community.

The great bulk of the Lower Classes, however, and almost all the Charibs and Spaniards who resort to the Settlement, are employed in the Mah Works in the Interior, and with them it is the practice to enter into Contract by which they hire themselves generally for six or twelve months. This is usually done at the commencement or middle of the year, when the servant goes before a Mag, & volunteers a Contract for his services. It is the enforcement of these Contracts, however, that the great evil lies. There is no law on the subject further than what custom has sanctioned. That custom has been, that where the Servant has failed in his Contract, the Master has had the power to bring him up at once on Warrant, and have him summarily punished by Imprisonment and public Whipping. If however the breach of Contract lay with the Master,—If for example, the Master was deficient in the payments he had contract to make his servant, the Servant could only sue the Master as in the matter of a common debt. To send the Servant into Court for hte recovery of his wages amounts to an absolute denial of justice to him. People in his condition are not supposed to possess the means of their remaining for months at Belize to prosecute thier suits for those very earnings which would enable them to reside there for alittle.

That misguided individual, the Freebooter General Walker, had at length run into the lion's mouth and found the fate he had so richly deserved. The last record of him may be worth preserving in our annals. A reward of two thousand dollars had been offered for his capture. H.M.S. *Icarus*, Commander N. Salmon, with a transport of troops under the command of Alvarez, had proceeded to Rio Negro, where Walker and his band had encamped. The boats of the *Icarus* passed up the river, captured Walker and seventy of his men, all of whom had been taken back to Truxillo, and given up to the authorities of [Sp] Honduras. Many of the men being sick, were permitted to return to the United States, on condition of never again engaging in an expedition against Central America. As for Walker and one of his colonerls, named Kudler, they were to be shot. And thus the freebooter met his fate. Being condemned, but with difficulty saved from popular fury, in his six days of imprisonment he had ample time for thought, and conscience smote him on contemplating his prison, and also on seeing the people that he had defeated and driven from their homes on the 6th of August [1860?] treating him with the greatest benevolence and kindness. Carried to the place of death and being ready to be executed, he begged leave to address the people in these few words:—""I declare myself to be a member of the Roman Catholic church. I declare that I have injured the people of [Sp] Honduras to a great extent, being led to do so by the people of the island of Ruatan, who, after calling me, deceived me and left me to my fate. I ask pardon for the poor men that accompanied me, for they are not so guilty as I am. If my life can be of any benefit to society I lay it down with the greatest readiness, pardoning my judges, that I may be enabled to obtain my pardon in the next world."" These were his last words, and with these the scene closed; it being worthy of notice that although the port of Truxillo was attacked ruthlessly by him, yet the people of the town pitied him, and in the whole crown there was not one glad countenance. /Naut Mag 1860 605–606 Link: https://hdl.handle.net/2027/nyp.33433066364856?urlappend=%3Bseq=613%3Bownerid=13510798882112364-669 /// See Regis A.

Quiero a Guat, pero quiero más a Belice. Los ingleses ya se han enterado por su servicio de Inteliencia, de estas pláticas. Están rápidamente trabajando para contraarrestarlas. Les advierto a ustedes que si no se apuran a tomar una decisión definitiva, y los ingleses entretanto, me hacen una proposición definitiva, y los ingleses entretanto, me hacen una proposición tan buena o mejor que la de Guat, y más rápida para ponerla en práctica, yo los abandono a ustedes, y me paso con mi partido al lado de Inglaterra."" ... Teníamos, pues, que movernos y ganar la carrera a los ingleses. /Idigoras 15–16 /// 24 Nov 1953 Lon.
