To account for this fragility, a return to economic history is needed. We focus on two critical periods. First, we examine why the Belizean state was unable to form a developmental state in the period of the anticolonial movement and self-government (the 1950s-1960s). Particular attention is given to George Price, leader of the anti-colonial People's United Party (PUP) and 'father of the country'. Second, turning to the post-colonial period, we examine one experimental chapter that lasted roughly a decade (1998-2007) when a coherent state-led economic strategy was pursued. During both periods the PUP-led state sought to reorganize development strategy along progressive lines, but failed to deliver. Because capital was almost completely foreign dominated, the fledgling Belizean developmental state could not discipline capital toward developmental alignment.
