Shipton the Pirate Commanded Nicholas Simons and Jonathan Barlow, who were two forc'd Men, and three Pirates, all double Armed, to take possession & charge of the Ship John & Mary, which they promised to do as well as they could, Simons as Navigator & Commander, with Orders to follow him : but after Shipton and his Men departed, Simons & Barlow unty'd Perry the Mate, set him at liberty, and discovered their Minds, that if he and his Company would stand by them, they would destroy the three Pirates, in order to get their own liberty, and the Ships Company from teh hands of such Cruel Pirates, and so make the best of their way to some English Port. Whereupon the Mate and his Company consented, and Barlow delivered one of his Pistols to Perry the Mate, who taking an Opportunity in teh Steergate, presented his Pistol at one of the Pirates, and snapt, so was oblig'd to retreat; the Pirate having 4 Pistols about him, immediately presented one at Perry, which likewise snapt. Simons being in the Cabbin, hearing the Pistol snapt, and perceiving it was att he mate, came out and said, ""In the Name of GOD, and HM King George, let us go on with our design?"" Whereupon he shot the strongest of the three Pirates thro' the body; and told the other, If he made any resistance, he should be a dead Man. Upon this, Barlow, or some of the Ships Company kill'd the other. Being now at Anchor, they cut their Cables, & made the best of their way. ... /BNL 1098"	"1 Pir killed, 1 [likely] mortally wounded"	some Bay prisoners at Carthagena < 3 Jun 20	xon	1 ship John and Mary taken / retaken by impressed mates / 5 had been prev taken	xon	xon	###

The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeche, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /Read’s Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer 375 p3"	"sev Baymen, Neg or Mos allies"	66 Eng men 5 Eng women 10 Neg	xon	"all Craft seized inc 3 Frig 1 Balandra w cargo [cargo = valor 11,687 pesos]"	"all ranchos, log burnt"	xon	###

The continental prints very seldom mingle any thing like a joke iwth their details. They have, however, taken up the notion, that the Court of Aldermen of London are about to present a petition upon the subject of the contested turtle fishery at the Bay of Honduras. /DA  /// KINGSTON, Sep 10 [1791]. Some misunderstandings are likely to take place between the Eng and Sp, on the coast of Honduras, owing to the absence of the British superintendant, who some months ago sailed for England, without leaving a deputy to transact his public business. During his absence, arrived a Sp commissary, who, as stipulated by the treaty of 1786, visits the British limits twice every years, to see that the conditions of the treaty are complied with.—The commissary not finding any person on the part of GB to receive him, and appoint a commissary to accompany him, as the treaty provides, sent to Gen Galvez, to acquaint him with the event. While he was waiting the answer, in visiting the islands along the Honduras coast, he found the Eng turtlers fishing beyond their limits; all of whom he seized, and detained till further orders. He has also threatened to cut down all the Eng planters walk; which may be attended with serious consequences—as plantains, with fish and turtles, constitute the principal food of the inhabitants of these coasts. /National Gazette [PA] I 10 p40 = 1 Dec 1791"	xon	xon	xon	xon	Sp commissary destroyed all cultivated spots [plantain walks] / arrested all turtle fishers / [likely seized all turtles]	xon	###

Juan Coatguelwin, capitan commandante de artillería) que considera el Rio Nuevo no comprendido en el distrito de este gobierno.—Con fecha 17 de Julio 1810 exigí de V.S. que dictara providencias para que ningun habitante de ese establecimiento volviera á entrar por las puntas de Piedra y Calentura á poner cortes de madera á otros trabajos de la parte de acá; y su contestacion, léjos de oponerse á esta circunstancia ni mirarla como nueva ó injusta, fué la de que iba á dar cuenta á los ministros de S.M.B. con mi oficio, y que entretanto permanecerian las cosas en el estado en que se hallaban. Ni los capitanes generales de Yucatan, ni los gobernadores de Bacalar desde que una declaracion de guerra abolió el tratado de paz de 1783 y convencion de 86, han creido que los súbditos británicos pudieran extenderse hasta dentro de dichas puntas: y la correspondencia que medió entre la capitanía general y esa superintendencia, despues del tratado de paz de Amiens, fué extendida en este concepto; sin que á él se oponga el que algunos con precaucion para no ser vistos de la vigía de San Antonio, hayan venido á dicho Rio Nuevo; y tengo una reciente prueba de que ellos mismos han graduado de ilícita su conducta, y es la de que el Sr. Wade, en papel que envió para mí con fecha 2 del corriente, no expresó el lugar donde estaba ni el cabo destacado en dicho vigía: por mas que preguntó á los conductores de dónde venian, consiguió descubrir la verdad, pues le dijeron que del Walix, hallándose Wade en la laguna del Tipú, ... /v Peniche 383 /xxx /// Gual a Smyth, Bacalar a 7 agosto 1812. Me dijo V.S. en su oficio de 22 de Febrero [1812], y con mas extension en el de 4 de Marzo, que los cortadores de madera habian estado cortándola en Rio Nuevo durante la guerra y siempre despues de ella. En este presidio todo el tiempo de la guerra hubo lo ménos triplicado número de tropas que en ese establecimiento, una lancha con un cañon de á 24, un ponton con uno de á 18, todas las piraguas armadas, y se hacian preparativos para una expedicion con fuerzas navales que debian venir de Campeche, y continuamente una piragua bien guarnecida y con artillería de guarda-costa, cruzando hasta mas de las puntas de Piedra y Calentura, y la misma subia por Rio Nuevo á la laguna del Tipú para reconocer sus crillas y particularmente el istmo que media entre el extremo de esta y el estero español ó *Spanish Creek*, habiendo sido el capitan D. .Manuel Melendez quien practicó esta diligencia al concluirse la guerra: de aquí inferirá V.S. que ningun cortador habia de incurrir en la temeridad de venir á Rio Nuevo con la seguridad de ser hecho prisionero; ... se me dió parte en Octubre [1810] de que se habian visto en la vigía de San Antonio dos ó tres botes: mandé al subteniente D. José Luis Melendez á hacer un reconocimento en Rio-Nuevo, lo subió y no halló huellas ni aun ramas cortadas, ni la menor señal de haber entrado hombres en él, y esto lo corrobora el que los ranchos encontrados por el capitan Melendez en Febrero último [1812], se componian de chozas pequeñísimas y muy nuevas, ... si V.S. pide informer hallará que todos han graduado allá de fraudulentos los cortes de los caballeros Hyde, y Bennet y otro, pues es punto que judicialmente se examinó y decidió en junta de magistrados por Julio del año pasado [1811]. ... En suma, los colonos Hyde y Bennet animados de su caudal, y el mulato Armstrong porque sirve á estos, se han hecho dueños de todo el rio [Nuevo], hasta el extremo de haber abusado del candor y buena fé de V.S. moviéndole con engaños á una providencia hostil de que despues trataré. Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D.

Bacalar, the chief fortified town of the seat of hostilities, is at present commanded by Gen. Zetina, and is well prepared to resist any siege. It was captured fm the Indians on 2d of Jul 1849, by a force of 800 men, consisting in part of American volunteers, at the expense of many lives, in consequence of large number of Indians in town (some three or four thousand), though majority of them were unarmed. Shortly after taking of Bac a Yucateco officer was captured, who had deserted to the Indians. He was pardoned, ordered into service again, and despatched with a party of men to reconnoitre the sea coast. Instead of that, however, he proceeded to an Eng village near Belize, Hon, murdered some of the inhabitants and plundered the place. The Eng Gov of Belize immediately sent word to the commander at Bac of this affair, who caused the offender, named Pacheco, to be sent for by a large force, and he was shot on his arrival, in presence of the Eng messenger.

Capt. Ratsey's Ship belongs to them now, and she is gone to Ireland for two hundred Barrels of Beef and bound directly to the Bay. They are to supply the Bay constantly with Provisions, a Year before-hand; and as to Freight, only send home, and what Freight we want will be immediately sent for. All the Bay-Men have met together, and have obliged themselves to deal with none but these Gentlemen; and any New-England Vessels that ocme after this Supply comes, there is a Forfeiture of Twenty Tons of chipt Wood for any Man that deals with them, or any Vessel but the Hope's. The said Gentlemen have bought Clarkson's Ship, and the Bay Trade our of his Hands, and have agreed with all other Merchants in Holland for the Logwood there to bring it to greater Price. There is no Dependance of any Vessels getting Wood after Christmas, only Debts that are due, or Vessels that belong here.

Several of the smaller settlers have lately been absolutely ruined by the robberies effected int heir property, by these desperadoes, who find immediate reception either at Bacalar or Truxillo: This reception is the more remarkable, those English criminals not being found to exhibit an improved state of morals; since for the commission of various crimes, upwards of twenty of those people were in confinement at the town of Bacalar, when the last advices were received—Roused at lenght, and irritated beyond bearance, the Magistrates and people in general, as we are informed, resolved, at a late general meeting, ""To oppose the admission of any more of these pests and outcasts; to admonish such commanders as may convey them there, to depart without debarking any of them; and, in case he should obstinately persist, to set the vessel or vessels on fire.” /NYP 574 /// See Kingston 24 Nov 1784 account in Pennsylvania Packet 1868 p3 = 31 Jan 1785 Link: https://infoweb-newsbank-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/apps/readex/doc?p=EANX&docref=image/v2%3A10CEB9BDCC081400%40EANX-10E687B30A264058%402373049-10E687B35806FC58%402-10E687B40B9BDCE0%40America.%2BKingston%252C%2BNovember%2B24"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

En el reconocimiento de la costa y cayos de Barlovento [bw Old and Bahía de la Ascensión], hallé entre estos, pescando fuera de límites, muchos súbditos ingleses a quienes decomisé la pesca, devolviéndoles sus buques y muebles y permitiéndoles regresar a los establecimientos apercibidos, con arreglo a las órdenes de que serían tratados con rigor en lo sucesivo ... Como para fines de Frebrero debía haber en la boca del Walix un Comisario Británico que me acompañase a la visita anterior de los establecimientos, ... pero encontrándome sin el Comisario, me pasé a Cayo Frixol, distante 3 leguas de dicha Boca a esperarlo. En el Cayo encontré un pescador establecido con su familia, y habiéndole hecho ver, que estaba cometiendo una infracción lo evacuó ... me trasladé el 15-3 a la Boca del Walix para practicar las diligencias que debían preceder al reconocimiento, y el 17 me informaron los Magistrados, que entre los papeles de Mr. Lorenze Meygham, que había fallecido a principios del mismo mes, habían encontrado un pliego de mi General para el de Jamaica, ... La operación de reconocer los huertas me proporcionó el ver perfectamente los establecimientos. En lo interior de ellos, no noté trangresión alguno de los que se recomiendan como graves en el Tratado ... y Convención ... Esto es obra de defensa u otras militares de artillería, o tropa, pero sí excesos en el cultivo, ... pero es de advertir, que dichos excesos son bastante depreciables para el que las vea; porque las huertas tan pretendidas no son otra cosa en lo general, que unos plantales, muchos de ellos mal cuidados, que tienen por objeto, no la delicadeza, sino el ahorro de víveres para los negros, pues no ví ni aun una lechuga en todos los establecimientos; bien que no por esto dejé de explicarme como debía, acerca de excederse en cuanto al terreno, y en lo tocante a las plantas de cultivo, considerando que cuando se tolera y disimula lo poco, lleguen los abusos a lo sumo; ... mi correspondencia con los Magistrados, aunque siempre los nombré con este título, fué solamente como unos sujetos particulares visibles; ... tuve el designio de no consentir en el sistema de policía que observan, por ser materia dudosa, aun entre ellos ... si S.M.B. puede, sin la anuencia de nuestro Soberano, disponer la observancia de dicho sistema ... En nlas riberas extra límites del Valis, su brazo y los esteros Black Crek y Spanish Crek, noté muchos y graves infracciones. Estas fueron el cultivo de varios pedazos de terreno, una considerable porción estraída de palo de Campeche y de mora, y como 700 árboles de caoba cortados, y sacados ... De éstos y de la cantidad de caoba extraída, no hubiera yo podido instruirme con toda exactitud, si no me hubiera auxiliado a ellos las noticias de habitantes fidedignos, las cuales no me fué difícil adquirir, porque el común de los habitantes detesta semejantes infracciones, y anhela el verlas remediadas, por lo que le dañan, haciendo descender el precio de la caoba con la excesiva abundancia a la mitad de lo que generalmente se considera necesario para que la corta sea útil a los cortadores. ... Los más de los pescadores de los establecimientos; hacen la pesca, especialmente la de la tortuga fuera de límites; entre los cayos que están al sur de los mismos establecimientos, y uno, y otro he oído que van a las islas inmediatas al Cabo Catoche ... No hay, como he dicho, en los establecimientos, obra alguno de defensa, ni el menos preparativo militar, pues de dos casas fuertes, que cuando yo salí para la visita, aún se dudaba si existían en la Boca de Jalova, no había en ésta ni señales de donde estuvieron, pero me hallo bien enterado de que el Oficial a quien se comisionó, para examinar el estado de las costas durante los últimos recelos de rompimiento, no padeció ni la más level equivocación en cuanto informó tocante a obras, a ejercicios militares, que quiso desfigurar el Sup Hunter; ... hay 9 Magistrados, de que bastan 3 para formar un cuerpo; transan las desavenencias civiles que ocurren entre los habitantes, y juzgan los delitos cometidos dentro de los límites, con autoridad de condenar a muerte, y hacer ejecutar la pena, fundando sus sentencias sobre las leyes generales de Inglaterra. Su oficio es anual, y se eligen los nuevos a principios de Mayo. Hay también otro cuerpo político que se titula el Gran Jury, y se compone de 12 habitantes juramentados cuya obligación es representar a los Magistrados en Juntas Generales, que se celebran cada 3 meses, todo lo que es necesario a favor del común. Así me explicó un Magistrado, persona de talento y verdad, dicho sistema. No hay Superintendente, ni esperan que la haya; .. /v Calderon 389 /MEXICO,3025"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

It is not long since (as appears by the Records of this Settlement) that this Body in a becoming, manly and spirited manner withstood an attack upon the dearest rights of British Subjects, made by a Military Force in direct opposition to Civil Authority, the people roused to a proper sense of their duty, unanimously came forward in Support of those Magistrates (who in the proper exercise of their Functions protected their Constituents) and pledged themselves individually and collectively to the utmost of their power, to support the Magistrates in their just endeavours to prevent the evils resulting form a tame submission to Military encroachment; in this very Court House did they cheerfully and unanimously place their Signatures to these laudable Resolves. It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community. After what has been transmitted to our Agent for the inspection of [Home] Government, what must His Majesty's Ministers think of the Bay of Honduras or will they ever respect or representations, Complaints or Memorials; and if some counterpoise is not immediately administered, is not he truth, Honor, respectability and Interest of this Settlement indelibly Stained and injured, by such an Egregious act of tergiversation."" Eighteen names recorded as in agreement with the above. /v Burdon 132 /MM B /// 6 Jun 1797 Pub Mtg Thomas Paslow proposes That all inhabitants wishing to evacuate the Country and not inclined to defend it be at liberty to leave after notice to Sup ... that if they fail to accomplish their evacuation within time granted they be considered and treated as forfeiting their allegiance : ""that the man who will not defend his Country is not entitled to reap the benefit thereof;"" /v Burdon 1 232 /MM A2 /PR 1"	np	np	np	np	np	np	###

This has, however, given rise to the most erroneous and dangerous impression (which is ever resorted to for time serving purposes) that the Authority of the Crown over the Settlement is of a very doubtful Character; and, consequently, the Right of interfering with the Settlers has been frequently called in question, and to this impression the greatest inconveniences may be readily traced.
