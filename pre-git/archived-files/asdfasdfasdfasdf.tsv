As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeche, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /RWJBG 375"

This interruption was followed by the expulsion of the settlers from those points of the coast which were considered as beyond the limits assigned in the recent treaty [of Paris 1763]. They were commanded to retire from Rio Hondo within the space of two months; they were confined to the south bank of Rio Nuevo; and both at Rio Nuevo and Rio Wallis, they were restricted from ascending to the distance of more than twenty leagues from the sea. By these aggressions, more than five hundred settlers were driven from their habitations, with the loss of their property, amounting to above £27,000 sterling. /v Coxe v 4 316 /Lord Auckland's Collections [MS.

New Port, July 17th [1724]. Samuel Pick, jun.

This Pick also informs us, That two days after they were taken, the Pirate took one Capt Hackins in a Ship called the Geelly Batchelour belonging to London, loaded with Logwood coming out of the Bay, which they burnt. They carried away his first & second Mate, with several of his Men, who ('tis thought) by ba usage comply'd to the Pirates Terms; the said Hackins, his Boatswain and an old Man they set on shore the said Island of Ratan (who afterward in a Sloop that touch'd there, which got away from the Bay when it was taken by the Spaniards,) and so had a passage to Jamaica. /BNL 1069"		2 men impressed		1 Sloop burnt

Rhode-Island, Dec. 4 [1724]. We are inform'd by Capt. John Cass in about 6 Weeks passage from the Bay of Hon, That Capt. Sprigs a Pirate, in a Ship called the Batchelours Delight, with a Consort of his in a Sloop, their number of Men in both Vessels were about 85. These came to the Bay the latter part of September last and took 10 or 12 Englisih Vessels that were there, who they had but a very few Days under their Command; by reason that HM Station Ship for Jamaica, Capt. James Windham, having Notice of the said Pirate, went in quest of them, and came up with them at the Bay, where they engaged, and shot Two shots tho' the said Pirates Ship, kill'd six of her Men, and Mortally wounded five or six more, carrying away their Legs & Arms; and also shot away her Bowsprit with four inches of her Fore Mast; but there being but little Wind the Pirates Vessels got into a Bay where it was shoal Water, that the Man of War could not come at them. By this Means the English Vessels that had been taken by the said Pirate were set at Liberty, and set sail for the several Ports to which they belonged and HMS for Jamaica again. The said Cass also informs, That there was a Frenchman deserted the Pirates before this ingagement. That gave an account that the Pirates had not a Weeks Provision on board, and 35 Men on board the Ship, and 50 on board the Sloop; they had Gunpowder enough, but no Shot. /BNL 1089"	"6 Pir killed, 5 or 6 more mortally wounded"	min 1 sloop co impressed		10 or 12 vessels taken / then liberated by Eng

Whereupon the Mate and his Company consented, and Barlow delivered one of his Pistols to Perry the Mate, who taking an Opportunity in teh Steergate, presented his Pistol at one of the Pirates, and snapt, so was oblig'd to retreat; the Pirate having 4 Pistols about him, immediately presented one at Perry, which likewise snapt.

Possibly see, Extract of a Letter from Campeche, dated 24 Nov 1731. As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the new River and that of Hondo; which last is distant form the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading form thence to the Bay. But our present [Sp] Governor, who is a Field-Marshal, and an old Officer, having resolv'd to rebuild and fortify Bacalar, after it had lain in Ruins for a long time, thereby to hinder the English from cutting Wood in those Parts, went thither in Person, and accomplished his Design; And thereafer with the Forces he carried with him from Campeche, and other he drew together from the Lake of Bacalar, he attacked the New Settlements of the English on these two last mentioned Rivers, burnt their Habitations, seiz'd all their Instruments for cutting Wood, and other Craft for carrying on their Trade, and the Year following served their Settlement on the River of Valis n the same Manner: So that in the Space of two Years, it is computed, he has taken about 140 Vessels of one sort or other, burnt upwards of 300,000 Quintals of Logwood, ready cut and piled upon the Shore, and made a great many of the English and their Negroes Prisoners. Upon this such as had escaped into the Woods came to this Resolution: They wrote to the Governor in June last, acquainting his Excellency, that they were wiling to abandon these Places and begg'd of him that he would allow them Time to transport themselves tot he Colonies of Great Britain; which he agreed to, and gave them to the last Day of January next for that Purpose: And this Agreement they have so far fulfilled, that at present by th east Accounts there scarce now remains in all those Parts 30 Persons, and these under such Hardships, that they wish for nothing more, than an Opportunity to be gone. This is the present Condition of the Bay of Honduras, which in all probability must continue, our Governor being resolved to protect the Trade, and defend the Possessions, which his Catholick Majesty has been pleased to commit to his Care and Government. /Read’s Weekly Journal or British Gazetteer 375 p3"	"sev Baymen, Neg or Mos allies"	66 Eng men 5 Eng women 10 Neg		"all Craft seized inc 3 Frig 1 Balandra w cargo [cargo = valor 11,687 pesos]"	"all ranchos, log burnt"

This scarcity is owing to all the logwood which lay any way contiguous to the river being cut down and brought away since we got possession of it.

""Thetis"" carring ""1800 screens of indigo, a large quantity of sarsaparilla, 29 chests of registered Money, and private property to a great amount"" was wrecked on the Northern Triangles. Towards the end of January two of her officers came to St. George's Key and after several attempts managed to reach the Triangles with a party of Baymen who agreed to help in getting off the cargo in return for proper salvage money. The Spaniards then removed the crew and register mone first to St. George's Key and thence to Bacalar, leaving Mr. John Lockhart Smith (a naval Lieutenant and a Bayman) in charge of the frigate and cargo. After the Spaniards had gone, several Bay vessels full of indigo arrived at the Key from the wreck, and letters from the Commandant at Bacalar inquiring about the cargo were not attended to. The Baymen proposed to confiscate the whole of it and when Ferrals remonstrated they threatened his life. The Frigate [Thetis], which lay high and dry was unnecessarily burnt. ""Sworn before me ...""

KINGSTON, Sep 10 [1791].

During his absence, arrived a Sp commissary, who, as stipulated by the treaty of 1786, visits the British limits twice every years, to see that the conditions of the treaty are complied with.—The commissary not finding any person on the part of GB to receive him, and appoint a commissary to accompany him, as the treaty provides, sent to Gen Galvez, to acquaint him with the event. While he was waiting the answer, in visiting the islands along the Honduras coast, he found the Eng turtlers fishing beyond their limits; all of whom he seized, and detained till further orders. He has also threatened to cut down all the Eng planters walk; which may be attended with serious consequences—as plantains, with fish and turtles, constitute the principal food of the inhabitants of these coasts. /National Gazette [PA] I 10 p40 = 1 Dec 1791"					Sp commissary destroyed all cultivated spots [plantain walks] / arrested all turtle fishers / [likely seized all turtles]

Gual a [Col John Nugent] Smyth, Bacalar a 28 febrero 1812. De mi oficio de 25 del corriente [feb 1812] habrá V.S. inferido la sorpresa que recibiria al primer parte que se me dió de haberse presentado en la boca del Rio Nuevo dos buques armados, cuyo cmoandante, de órden de V.S., hizo retirar el pequeño destacamento que habia yo mandado á aquel puerto de mi jurisdiccion, y desde luego creí que algun equivocado informe habria sido la causa; pero mas me ha sorprendido vern en el oficio de V.S. del 22 (que me entregó ayer D. Juan Coatguelwin, capitan commandante de artillería) que considera el Rio Nuevo no comprendido en el distrito de este gobierno.—Con fecha 17 de Julio 1810 exigí de V.S. que dictara providencias para que ningun habitante de ese establecimiento volviera á entrar por las puntas de Piedra y Calentura á poner cortes de madera á otros trabajos de la parte de acá; y su contestacion, léjos de oponerse á esta circunstancia ni mirarla como nueva ó injusta, fué la de que iba á dar cuenta á los ministros de S.M.B. con mi oficio, y que entretanto permanecerian las cosas en el estado en que se hallaban. Ni los capitanes generales de Yucatan, ni los gobernadores de Bacalar desde que una declaracion de guerra abolió el tratado de paz de 1783 y convencion de 86, han creido que los súbditos británicos pudieran extenderse hasta dentro de dichas puntas: y la correspondencia que medió entre la capitanía general y esa superintendencia, despues del tratado de paz de Amiens, fué extendida en este concepto; sin que á él se oponga el que algunos con precaucion para no ser vistos de la vigía de San Antonio, hayan venido á dicho Rio Nuevo; y tengo una reciente prueba de que ellos mismos han graduado de ilícita su conducta, y es la de que el Sr. Wade, en papel que envió para mí con fecha 2 del corriente, no expresó el lugar donde estaba ni el cabo destacado en dicho vigía: por mas que preguntó á los conductores de dónde venian, consiguió descubrir la verdad, pues le dijeron que del Walix, hallándose Wade en la laguna del Tipú, ... /v Peniche 383 /xxx

Gual a Smyth, Bacalar a 7 agosto 1812. Me dijo V.S. en su oficio de 22 de Febrero [1812], y con mas extension en el de 4 de Marzo, que los cortadores de madera habian estado cortándola en Rio Nuevo durante la guerra y siempre despues de ella. En este presidio todo el tiempo de la guerra hubo lo ménos triplicado número de tropas que en ese establecimiento, una lancha con un cañon de á 24, un ponton con uno de á 18, todas las piraguas armadas, y se hacian preparativos para una expedicion con fuerzas navales que debian venir de Campeche, y continuamente una piragua bien guarnecida y con artillería de guarda-costa, cruzando hasta mas de las puntas de Piedra y Calentura, y la misma subia por Rio Nuevo á la laguna del Tipú para reconocer sus crillas y particularmente el istmo que media entre el extremo de esta y el estero español ó *Spanish Creek*, habiendo sido el capitan D. .Manuel Melendez quien practicó esta diligencia al concluirse la guerra: de aquí inferirá V.S. que ningun cortador habia de incurrir en la temeridad de venir á Rio Nuevo con la seguridad de ser hecho prisionero; ... se me dió parte en Octubre [1810] de que se habian visto en la vigía de San Antonio dos ó tres botes: mandé al subteniente D. José Luis Melendez á hacer un reconocimento en Rio-Nuevo, lo subió y no halló huellas ni aun ramas cortadas, ni la menor señal de haber entrado hombres en él, y esto lo corrobora el que los ranchos encontrados por el capitan Melendez en Febrero último [1812], se componian de chozas pequeñísimas y muy nuevas, ... si V.S. pide informer hallará que todos han graduado allá de fraudulentos los cortes de los caballeros Hyde, y Bennet y otro, pues es punto que judicialmente se examinó y decidió en junta de magistrados por Julio del año pasado [1811]. ... En suma, los colonos Hyde y Bennet animados de su caudal, y el mulato Armstrong porque sirve á estos, se han hecho dueños de todo el rio [Nuevo], hasta el extremo de haber abusado del candor y buena fé de V.S. moviéndole con engaños á una providencia hostil de que despues trataré. Habiendo sido la mia tan moderada, que solo envié una piragua con un oficial y veinte hombres, con órdenes terminantes para usar de la mayor atencion y suavidad en un parage que era asilo de desertores y reos de otros delitos, y donde los cortadores tenian ciento ó mas negros esclavos.—V.S. en sus citados oficios considera las dos riberas de Rio-Nuevo y la meridional de Rio-Hondo, como unos terrenos á que tienen derecho los colonos ingleses y sobre que hay discusion pendiente entre los dos gobiernos. ... en mis oficios de 17 de julio de 1810 y 25 de Febrero último, no hice reclamo alguno sobre la ocupacion de muchas leguas de la ribera septentrional desde el punto donde desgua el estero negro ó *Black Creek* para arriba, ni dí por confiscadas las ochocientas piezas de caoba cortadas en la misma ribera, fundéndome en que no había camino abierto hasta la laguna del Tipú para extraerlas por Rio-Nuevo, y porque se hallaban en terreno ocupado por las fuerzas británicas aunque fuera de los límites señalados por el tratado de 83 y convencion de 86. ... He probado con claridad y solidez que los colonos ingleses no tiene derecho alguno á cortar maderas en Rio-Nuevo y Rio-Hondo, como no ocupados por las fueras británicas ni de otro modo en la última guerra; que los cortes que hay ahora en Rio-Nuevo, son recientes y fraudulentos; que sus dueños abusando de la rectitude de V.S. y fiados en que hace solo tres años que llegó á ese establecimiento, donde no encontró en su archivo la correspondencia sobre la materia con la capitanía general de esta provincia, que le diese luces sobre las verdades que llevo referidas, se han atrevido á engañarle para que dictase una providencia cuya ejecucion léjos de ser tan moderada como indican sus oficios de 22 de Febrero y 4 de Marzo, fué en extremo violenta; pues el comandante D. Juan Coatguelwin, llegó á la embocadura del Rio-Nuevo como á las tres de la tarde del 24 de Febrero con tres goletas, dos de ellas armada cada una con un cañon de grueso calibre á proa, tres obuses en las bandas y crecido número de tropas cargando sus armas; pasó á su bordo el sargento comandante del pequeño destacamento de un cabo y seis soldados que habia mandado yo á quiel punto con órdenes llenas de lenidad, respecto de los individuos para que saliesen libremente con sus equipages y armas de cazar, y con el único objeto de que no permitiese extraer las maderas justamente confiscadas; ... /v Peniche 385 /xxx"

Ademas, protegió abiertamente el tráfico de armas, municiones y demas recursos de guerra que se suministraban á los bárbaros, y persiguió á nuestro compatriota D.

Possibly see, Fm Boston Traveller. INDIAN WAR IN YUC. A recent conversation with Lt Clement, a returned volunteer in the Yuc service, with which he has been associated some two years, has furnished us with a variety of interesting details ... Bacalar, the chief fortified town of the seat of hostilities, is at present commanded by Gen. Zetina, and is well prepared to resist any siege. It was captured fm the Indians on 2d of Jul 1849, by a force of 800 men, consisting in part of American volunteers, at the expense of many lives, in consequence of large number of Indians in town (some three or four thousand), though majority of them were unarmed. Shortly after taking of Bac a Yucateco officer was captured, who had deserted to the Indians. He was pardoned, ordered into service again, and despatched with a party of men to reconnoitre the sea coast. Instead of that, however, he proceeded to an Eng village near Belize, Hon, murdered some of the inhabitants and plundered the place. The Eng Gov of Belize immediately sent word to the commander at Bac of this affair, who caused the offender, named Pacheco, to be sent for by a large force, and he was shot on his arrival, in presence of the Eng messenger. It is feared that this action will case bad results. ... /Commercial Advertiser [NYC] LIII [sn] p1 = 23 Feb 1850 Link: https://infoweb-newsbank-com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/apps/readex/doc?p=EANX&docref=image/v2%3A1044E924036998A0%40EANX-1405B75C86FF7548%402396812-14059E1E0EA73880%400-14090FFFF92551A2%40Indian%2BWar%2BIn%2BYucatan

That fire burned a large amount of property in their warehouses, on its way to Europe and your city, via this port; and as the loss fell on the owners, many of them changed the route of their produce, and now send down tot he railroad at Panama, or by sea round the Horn, fm the Pacific.

All other local excitements had been lulled for the time by that caused in consequence of the failure of the house of James Hyde & Co. which was brought down owing to the insolvency of Messrs. Hyde, Hodge & Co., of London. An attempt was made to merge the affairs of the Belize house with those of the concern in England, and great alarm was felt amongst the local creditors in consequence; but the effort was neutralized by a decision of the Sup Ct. Owing to commercial failures trade was very dull and money remained scarce. The mahogany cutters had enjoyed a profitable season.

The latter part of the report was not correct, for they attacked nobody, and retired soon after they came. Still it is not pleasant to have them so near in such large numbers, as they know no law, and when excited fear no consequences, and could, if disposed, cut the mahogany cutters to pieces, rob the banks and destroy all the property on the banks, before assistance could reach them. This causes continual fears and excitement in town.

An immense amount of property was destroyed and numerous disasters to shipping occurred on the coast. The town of Belize was almost inundated by the sea, which rose some four to six feet above the ordinary high tides. Several houses were blown down and many stores and other buildings unroofed. Fences, kitchens, outhouses and small buildings were swept away by the flood. The wharves and storehouses on the wharves were under water. The rain fell in torrents and was blown into every hole and corner, while the day seemed as if turned into night. It was thought that widespread want would soon be upon the inhabitants, as all the plantations have been blown down or very much injured. /NYH 10258

It is ascertained that Mr. Rhys, the commissioner to the Indians, whom the expedition was sent to support, was left wounded on the battle field. Two days after the battle he, with a soldier who had been left for dead, crawled out on the road towards the nearest villa to the field when they were met by six Indians and shot. /New York Herald 11137 p6 = 26 Feb 1867"	5 men killed / Rhys assumed killed				all equipment left behind	16 men wounded

[Captain Domingo de] Tartas reports that when they conquered Campeche, the Dutch were led by a mulatto named Diego Martin, born in Havana. This man was a formidable pirate. He [Tartas] was told that he [Diego] had been brought up among the Dutch; so much is certain that he was already associated with them in this year 1633, later also in Curaçao ([Wright/van Dam, v 1,] page 128, note 2 and the beginning of Document No. 29) and in 1638, when he was said to have served under Jol in the battle at the height of Cabañas (cf. AGI 141-1-16, The Council for War Affairs in the Indies to His Majesty, May 16, 1638). In May of the year 1638, El Mulato asked forgiveness from the Spanish Crown, which was soon granted. But he did not appear in Havana, where he had offered to go; and in 1641 he was robbing and murdering in the name of the Prince of Orange. Cf. AGI 54-1-17, Riaño at the Crown, Havana, November 13, 1638; 147-5-22 The Council for War Affairs in the Indies to His Majesty, March 4, 1639; 78-2-3, Vol. 10, f. 131r, and f. 133, cédulas to Diego Martin, 15 March 1639; to Riaño of the same date; f. 183, cédula to the governor of Margarita, Saragossa, August 5, 1645, in which he is warned that Dieguillo was plotting with the Duke of Braganza for the purpose of taking possession of the island for Portugal; 54-2-11, 16 September 1639, Riaño hands over to his successor cédulas concerning Diego Martin; 54-1-18, 1 September 1641, Diego el Mulato takes possession of an advisory boat from Cartagena at the height of Havana, with a considerable loss of human life on the part of the Spaniards, to whom he orders to ""fly the flag for the Prince of Orange”. /Wright/van Dam, v 1, 297"

Only six villages of some 150 families ... remained loyal to the [Sp] crown; but of these some had fled to the forests ""either out of fear that they would be carried off by the rebels or for not being able to tolerate the weight of the work, being so few."" /via Jones 1 p210 /xxx [Bishop of Yucatán to Crown, 5 mar 1643]

All of these events [eg massacres at Tah Itza in 1623, at Sacalum in 1624], ... were the prelude ot the dramatic collapse of Spanish control over most of the Maya towns of the Bacalar province beginning in 1638, the opening year of Katun 1 Ahau. This loss of colonial control was by 1642 replaced by a regenerated Maya leadership based at Tipu. /Jones 1 p190

Complicating our understanding of the period [1638–42] are the poorly understood effects of increasing depredations of foreign pirates along the eastern coasts [of Bacalar province], which ceertainly would have stimulated coastal Mayas to seek refuge in interior locations around Tipu. These depredations, in combination with independence movements at Tipu, had devastating implications for the villa of Bacalar, which was already in a weakened state due to its administration by an absentee leadership based at Valladolid. /Jones 1 p191

These [Sp, mulattos and mestizos of Bacalar], he [Gov of Yuc] said, numbered only about 50 and were a miserable, poor lot, living by going from village to vilage selling things which they bartered for the locally produced cacao. In so doing, he claimed, they extorted the Indians. /Jones 1 p205 /MEXICO,360 [10 jul 1638] / on extortion see eg MEXICO,369 ff 537r–539 /v Barke 12 61

[80 Ma from Manan and Chinam] have declared that by deceits and threats from the Indians of Tipu, by messages they had sent them that they were to give obedience to their king and wished them to abandon their town [Manan], saying that if they did not do so all would die and be finished, because at such a time the Itzas would come to kill them and there would be great mortalities and hurricanes that would flood the land. /via Jones 1 p207 /xxx [20 sep 1638] / Holpatin likewise received these reports from Tipu, per Bacalar intelligence /via Jones 1 p208

Extract of a Letter from Campeche in the Province of Yucatan, dated Nov. 24. [1731] As to the State of the Bay of Honduras, I shall give it you as briefly as possible. The ancient City of Bacalar, situate in that Part of the Province of Yucatan, which lies on the Bay of Honduras, was twice sack'd, and at last totally ruined by the English many Years ago; on which the Logwood-Cutters of that Nation, who had settled on the River of Valis, possessed themselves of the New River and that of Hondo; which last is distance from the Ruins of Bacalar about five Leagues. Here they built a great many Houses and Hutts, and employ'd Multitudes of Negroes in cutting Logwood, which was transported to Jamaica and Europe by Numbers of Vessels trading from thence to the Bay ... /RWJBG 375

""A Grand Conferrence is appointed to be held the 30th Instant at the Duke of Bedford's; where will be present, the principal Members of the Privy Council, in order to consider of certain Proposition that are to be made to the Court of Spain, for obviating once for all the Difficulties to which Commerce and Navigation of the English in the American Seas are exposes, notwithstanding the Stipulations in the Treaty sign'd at Madrid the 5th of October last. At the same Conference or Council, they are likewise to enquire into the Validity of the Seizure of 21 Eng Vessels, taken by the Sp in the Bay of Hon, as was mention'd some Time ago; for though the Captures make a great Noise, and occassion much murmuring, the Ministry will not take upon them to make Complaints at Madrid, without first enquiring with what Design those Vessels sail'd into the Gulph or Bay of Hon, who were the Owner of them, what Goods they had on Board, and whether it can be clearly proved that they were not sent upon the Contraband Trade; and if it shall appear that the Seizure was illegal, and that their being employ'd in a Contraband Trade was only a Pretext of the Sp to detain them, 'tis not doubted but that the Affair will be seriously prosecuted at the Court of Madrid, as in this Cse one may expect full satisfaction from that Court, pursuant to the Promises made to Mr. Keene."" /New-York Evening Post 217 p2 = 17 Jun 1751

The man immediately seized the Capt's scimitar with one hand, and with the other gave him three stabs in the left breast with a long knife, of which wounds he expred instantly upon the quarter deck. By assistane from the ships in the harbour the murderer was secured. The next morning the coroner's jury brought in their verdict wilful murder, and the man himself has since contested the fact.

Few communities endure so many difficulties as the settlers in he above-mentioned Bay; but as if their situation was directly the revese, and claimed chastisement lest they should be too happy, it pleases their kind Governors in England, to deprive them of any one moment's safety or satisfaction, by continually deluging them wiht torrents of convicts of the most unprincipled kind. Several of the smaller settlers have lately been absolutely ruined by the robberies effected int heir property, by these desperadoes, who find immediate reception either at Bacalar or Truxillo: This reception is the more remarkable, those English criminals not being found to exhibit an improved state of morals; since for the commission of various crimes, upwards of twenty of those people were in confinement at the town of Bacalar, when the last advices were received—Roused at lenght, and irritated beyond bearance, the Magistrates and people in general, as we are informed, resolved, at a late general meeting, ""To oppose the admission of any more of these pests and outcasts; to admonish such commanders as may convey them there, to depart without debarking any of them; and, in case he should obstinately persist, to set the vessel or vessels on fire.” /NYP 574

Grimarest a Sonora, Bacalar a 13 abril 1787. ... [Col Despard] me dió cuenta en carta de 26-3-787 ... de haber contravenido varios colonos en sus establecimientos, a la línea demarcada por los Comisarios de las dos Coronas en el año de 1783, aposesionándose antes de verificr la que está pendiente de resulta de los terrenos ampliados en la nueva convención, de la parte meridional de la boca del río Walix, sin embargo de sus representaciones, amonestaciones y amenazas, a que le replicaron igualmente con las mismas, rehusando el separarse de aquel paraje. Como este aviso incluía las circunstancias de que yo tomase las medidas convenientes sobre el particular, respecto a que los tenía declarados fuera de la protección del Rey de la Gran Bretaña, regulé por más adecuado a la delicadeza del asunto y a no empeñar algún lancecillo que ocasionase disgustos en el tiempo más crítico de estarse cumpliendo la evacuación del territorio de Mosquitos, y por otra parte no manifestar una debilidad repugnante a los mismos derechos de la soberanía española, no obstante de ser el citado paraje uno de los comprendidos en la demarcación de los ampliados, dispuse que ... pasase el Captián de los Reales Ejércitos, con sueldo de vivo y efectivo, D. Rafael Bresón, Ayudante Mayor de la Plaza de Campeche, y nombrado por mí para los objectos de esta Comisión, y de acuerdo con el enunciado Despard, procediese a dejar cumplida la voluntad del Rey, y el artículo 13 de la presente Convención, manejándose con toda la cordua indispensable a la gravedad de su cargo. Salió este oficial el día 2 de este mas para el Walis, y habiéndose puesto de buena fe con el Superinendente inglés, logró en los días 4, 5 y 6 del mismo, con la mayor felicidad, la transmigración de los referidos colonos a la parte del norte que les es permitida, persuadiéndoles a ella con todo de su repugnancia, con moderación, prudencia, y humanidad; y para precaver que volviesen a ocupar éstos, u otros nuevos, las casas ... previno al Cadete del Batallón de Castilla D. Félix López de Toledo, que con 4 granaderos del mismo Cuerpo, permaniese sobre aquel terreno, y observase la orden, que por escrito le dió al efecto, ... obrando en cualquier evento con anuencia del Capitán de la Balandra que está a mis órdenes D.

Ricardo Hoar, no obstante las reconvenciones prudentes que al efecto le hizo a vista de las casas, muebles y ocupaciones en que se empleaba de aserrar maderas, al pretexto de suponerse se hallaba en pesquería, usando en su contestación de un modo nada conforme al espíritu que debe existir, al ejemplo del cordialidad y buena fe establecido entre las dos Cortes de Madrid y Londres. Este incidente, y el no aventurar ningún lance ajeno de las circunstancias que más interesan en el día, me obligó a dirigir mi recurso al Coronel D. E. M.

Grimarest a Sonora, Bacalar a 20 ago 1787. Llevado de mi celo y amor al real servicio, no puedo menos de exponer a V.E. lo doloroso que fué el ver al remontar el río Walix, lo devastado y arruinado que tenían los ingleses los montes de la ribera de dicho río, que se iba a comprener en la ampliación de los terrenos últimamente concedidos, teniendo en ella establecimientos formales de mucho tiempo anterior, y también la ribera que ni les era dedida por el Tratado Definitivo de Paz, ni se incluía en la ampliación que iba a practicar, excediéndose hasta más de 60 leguas internados en dicho río, y en el brazo del Oeste. En consideración a que ya le tenía entregado al Sup Despard, desde el día 18 de Julio la parte meridional del Walis, haste el número de leguas descubiertas en el Sibún, en el entretanto emprendíamos el reconocimiento y averiguación de su origen, me pareció oportuno, no obstante a que no dejé de explicarme con el referido Superintendente, el disimular prudente aquellos excesos, pero por lo respectivo a los que no podían mirarse con esa indiferencia, tomé sobre mi el cuidado de ir intimidando a los ingleses situados en aquellos establecimientos a que se desalojasen de ellos, pues a mi regreso (como lo ejecuté) había de destruirlos, y en muchos ranchos en donde no encontré persona alguno, por haberlos desamparado enterados de que subía, los quemé con su [Despard?] acuerdo, después de haber examinado personal y unidamente los montes, en que patenticé el gran número de piezas trozadas en aquellos parajes, y destiné al Capt Rafael Breson, para que con el mismo Despard, siguiese la propia diligencia, desde el Real de demarcación hasta el brazo del oeste. En el intermedio de nuestras operaciones, no sólo se desalojaron, pero precipitadamente arrojaron al agua, y condujeron a la boca, considerable número de las tozas de caoba que tenían cortadas, y ví a mi subida: las cuales llegaban a más de 1000, y por esta razón, me fué imposible el marcarlas con la del Rey a mi vuelta, y sólo lo pude hacer de una corta porción de ellas, y otras que se quemaron, por ser poco útiles, y para que sirviera de ejemplo a la pena del contrabando; protestando a V. E. que el enunciado Despard, me manifestó que sin reflexión a su autoridad ni a sus reconvenciones, llegaba este desorden hasta tocar en hacer ventas con sintrumentos públicos de los terrenos españoles, y formar pleitos contenciosos, entre si el derecho que unos suponían a la madera que cortaban, aventurando a sus negros, y demás gastos si los aprendían los españoles, y otros alegando propiedad sobre el terreno en que lo verificaban ... /v Calderon 322 /MEXICO,3023"

1789, November 10th. Sec of State Grenville to Despard. Suspending him ... it is difficult to explain ""the irregularity of the whole of those [Sp Commissary visits] proceedings"" with the Spanish Commissary. The sole purpose of the visits by Spanish Officers is to see that no forts are erected by the Settlers, and the British commissaries accompany them to see that this purpose is fulfilled. The giving HM sanction and authority to the destruction of the Plantations by the Spanish Commissary was ""an act highly exceptionable."" Gual should have reported finding them to his superiors, as their status was doubtful and Spain has since given her consent to such cultivation. Similarly Gual should have been permitted to report the finding of the system of Magistrates to his superiors. Despard knew that the introduciton of a Plan of Police was under consideration in England. Even if Gual had been right in making the complaint and Despard had been authorised to abolish the Courts it would have been wrong to do so since the Settlement could not subsist without them and he himself proceeded to set up an alternative system ""equally liable to the objection by which you declared the former to be illegal."" /via Burdon 1 p180 /CO 123/8

En el reconocimiento de la costa y cayos de Barlovento [bw Old and Bahía de la Ascensión], hallé entre estos, pescando fuera de límites, muchos súbditos ingleses a quienes decomisé la pesca, devolviéndoles sus buques y muebles y permitiéndoles regresar a los establecimientos apercibidos, con arreglo a las órdenes de que serían tratados con rigor en lo sucesivo ... Como para fines de Frebrero debía haber en la boca del Walix un Comisario Británico que me acompañase a la visita anterior de los establecimientos, ... pero encontrándome sin el Comisario, me pasé a Cayo Frixol, distante 3 leguas de dicha Boca a esperarlo. En el Cayo encontré un pescador establecido con su familia, y habiéndole hecho ver, que estaba cometiendo una infracción lo evacuó ... me trasladé el 15-3 a la Boca del Walix para practicar las diligencias que debían preceder al reconocimiento, y el 17 me informaron los Magistrados, que entre los papeles de Mr. Lorenze Meygham, que había fallecido a principios del mismo mes, habían encontrado un pliego de mi General para el de Jamaica, ... La operación de reconocer los huertas me proporcionó el ver perfectamente los establecimientos. En lo interior de ellos, no noté trangresión alguno de los que se recomiendan como graves en el Tratado ... y Convención ... Esto es obra de defensa u otras militares de artillería, o tropa, pero sí excesos en el cultivo, ... pero es de advertir, que dichos excesos son bastante depreciables para el que las vea; porque las huertas tan pretendidas no son otra cosa en lo general, que unos plantales, muchos de ellos mal cuidados, que tienen por objeto, no la delicadeza, sino el ahorro de víveres para los negros, pues no ví ni aun una lechuga en todos los establecimientos; bien que no por esto dejé de explicarme como debía, acerca de excederse en cuanto al terreno, y en lo tocante a las plantas de cultivo, considerando que cuando se tolera y disimula lo poco, lleguen los abusos a lo sumo; ... mi correspondencia con los Magistrados, aunque siempre los nombré con este título, fué solamente como unos sujetos particulares visibles; ... tuve el designio de no consentir en el sistema de policía que observan, por ser materia dudosa, aun entre ellos ... si S.M.B. puede, sin la anuencia de nuestro Soberano, disponer la observancia de dicho sistema ... En nlas riberas extra límites del Valis, su brazo y los esteros Black Crek y Spanish Crek, noté muchos y graves infracciones. Estas fueron el cultivo de varios pedazos de terreno, una considerable porción estraída de palo de Campeche y de mora, y como 700 árboles de caoba cortados, y sacados ... De éstos y de la cantidad de caoba extraída, no hubiera yo podido instruirme con toda exactitud, si no me hubiera auxiliado a ellos las noticias de habitantes fidedignos, las cuales no me fué difícil adquirir, porque el común de los habitantes detesta semejantes infracciones, y anhela el verlas remediadas, por lo que le dañan, haciendo descender el precio de la caoba con la excesiva abundancia a la mitad de lo que generalmente se considera necesario para que la corta sea útil a los cortadores. ... Los más de los pescadores de los establecimientos; hacen la pesca, especialmente la de la tortuga fuera de límites; entre los cayos que están al sur de los mismos establecimientos, y uno, y otro he oído que van a las islas inmediatas al Cabo Catoche ... No hay, como he dicho, en los establecimientos, obra alguno de defensa, ni el menos preparativo militar, pues de dos casas fuertes, que cuando yo salí para la visita, aún se dudaba si existían en la Boca de Jalova, no había en ésta ni señales de donde estuvieron, pero me hallo bien enterado de que el Oficial a quien se comisionó, para examinar el estado de las costas durante los últimos recelos de rompimiento, no padeció ni la más level equivocación en cuanto informó tocante a obras, a ejercicios militares, que quiso desfigurar el Sup Hunter; ... hay 9 Magistrados, de que bastan 3 para formar un cuerpo; transan las desavenencias civiles que ocurren entre los habitantes, y juzgan los delitos cometidos dentro de los límites, con autoridad de condenar a muerte, y hacer ejecutar la pena, fundando sus sentencias sobre las leyes generales de Inglaterra. Su oficio es anual, y se eligen los nuevos a principios de Mayo. Hay también otro cuerpo político que se titula el Gran Jury, y se compone de 12 habitantes juramentados cuya obligación es representar a los Magistrados en Juntas Generales, que se celebran cada 3 meses, todo lo que es necesario a favor del común.

WHEREAS it appears that a few evil minded Persons either from Pique or malice are willing to lead the Public astray and draw them from their proper allegiance to HM Government, the Superintendent requests that the People will individually weigh what follows and treat it with coolness and candour. The present Contest between the Superintendent and Magistrates is not whether there should or should not be Public meetings but whether they should be with or without his approbation and that such meeting should be enabled to form Laws that should be binding to the Settlement without either his approbation or concurrence. He appeals to the Public whether any Gentleman would accept of the situations of Superintendent and Commanding in Chief of the Settlement situated as this is, surrounded by enemies and responsible for the safety of it to HM and the Gov of Jam and allow the Sovreignty of it to be wrested from him and usurped which in this case it must be by a Set of People very inadequate to the task. ... /via Burdon 2 /ML B

The Magistates disclaim any idea of offering the least opposition to HM Sup Comm in Chief in the due execution of his Authority or of usurping powers not legally vested in them, and they request their Constituents to continue that peaceable and loyal demeanour they have ever held. ...

It is not long since (as appears by the Records of this Settlement) that this Body in a becoming, manly and spirited manner withstood an attack upon the dearest rights of British Subjects, made by a Military Force in direct opposition to Civil Authority, the people roused to a proper sense of their duty, unanimously came forward in Support of those Magistrates (who in the proper exercise of their Functions protected their Constituents) and pledged themselves individually and collectively to the utmost of their power, to support the Magistrates in their just endeavours to prevent the evils resulting form a tame submission to Military encroachment; in this very Court House did they cheerfully and unanimously place their Signatures to these laudable Resolves. It is not then astonishing, that, although the same undeviating contempt has continued to the last day to be exercised towards the Civil Authority by Lieutenant Colonel Hamilton (as appears by sufficient documents) a set of men could be found to address him on this departure, expressing the cause of that address to be on Account ""ofo the readiness he evinced in Support of the Civil Authority of this Settlemetn""—never did the Annals of any Country (boasting reservedly of the freedom of our glorious constitution) furnish such an example of weakness and inconsistency as to contradict in Specific terms, the clearest facts, sanctioned by the Strongest Documents, and a general vote of the Community. After what has been transmitted to our Agent for the inspection of [Home] Government, what must His Majesty's Ministers think of the Bay of Honduras or will they ever respect or representations, Complaints or Memorials; and if some counterpoise is not immediately administered, is not he truth, Honor, respectability and Interest of this Settlement indelibly Stained and injured, by such an Egregious act of tergiversation."" Eighteen names recorded as in agreement with the above. /v Burdon 132 /MM B

Consider who are the persons so actively employed and busied in your Public Affiars—whispering in your Ears the pleasing sound of Freedom and Independence, and of casting off the shackles of those, whom they would persuade you, are your oppressors. ... Now Gentlemen let me ask you, what can my observations be on your Civil Situation? Would you have me discribe the disrespect with which your Magistrates are treated? The Discord and Tumult which prevail at your Public Meetins? The vile attempt which has been made to introduce Black and Charabs to vote at your assemblies? and to fill up the Picture, the system which has been adopted within the last few Days at the Election of your Magistrates? ... What Statement am I to afford with regard to your Finances? Am I to tell HM Gov that you reject and resist every system proposed for raising Money? and, that, so far from coming forward to assist Government, you are unwilling to contribute even to those Essentials on which the safety and security of your very lives depend. The Bridge is known by every Individual to be in so ruinous a state that it can scarcely be expected to hold together form day to day— ... The Church, which has been erected at so great an expence, cannot be rendered useful to the Public—The Jail has fallen into such decay that the most notorious Offender may make his escape at pleasure—and a Debt has been contracted to the Amount of nearly 10,000 Pounds, which in honour the Public is bound to liquidate—with all these circumstances before you opposition is made to every means of raising Money, ... No one as a Matter of convenience would prefer being taxed, but when the Welfare of the Community depends upon it, surely no man would be so selfish as to withold his contribution. To those in particular, I would address myself who are Natives of this Settlement, who have been born and brought up in Honduras with all their Families and Friends about them—surely, you must feel a powerful Attachment to your native Soil, and cannot but wish to see it thrive and flourish in Tranquility. ...” Pub Mtg resolve 39–0 hearty concurrence with Sup sentiments particularly in matter of change in Civil System, and unqualified thanks for his attention to Public Welfare.

The great delicacy with which the British Gov has acted towards the Court of Madrid has retarded the introduction of a more regular form of Gov and the unavoidable difficulties which naturally result from the present anomalous system must be considred to have been endured, rather than excite any misunderstanding with Spain. This has, however, given rise to the most erroneous and dangerous impression (which is ever resorted to for time serving purposes) that the Authority of the Crown over the Settlement is of a very doubtful Character; and, consequently, the Right of interfering with the Settlers has been frequently called in question, and to this impression the greatest inconveniences may be readily traced. It would certainly be highly desirable that the duties and office of the Sup should be more distinctly defined and understood, but under present circumstances the system which HM Gov has approved and directed is that all measures, whether of a legislative or Judicial Nature, endangerine the security or tranquility of the Settlement, or interfering with the Rights of the Crown shall be stayed, and a Special Reprt made for instructions thereon to HM Sec of State. ... /v Burdon 2 256 /R 2"

Free persons of Colour are not allowed to hold Commission during the War with Spain, and when the Colony was actually attacked they did hold Commssions, but upon a recent organization of that Corps they have been excluded. Court of Justice. The Supreme Criminal Court consists of Commissioners appointed by the King's commission under the 59 Geo: 3. They are in number 4 or more. The Civil Court consists of 7 Magistrates who are elected by the Inhabitants—and for them the free people vote: but no person of Colour has hitherto been nominated by the King's Commission to be a Judge of the Criminal Court, and they are considered to be disqualified to be elected Members of the Civil Court. ... For this exclusion from the Magistracy etc. there is no positive Law; it rests upon custom only. Honduras is essentially distinguished form Jamaica and the West India Islands in very important particulars. Nearly two thirds of the whole property at Honduras in Land, Slaves, and personalty belong to the free coloured class exclusive of the free blacks; they enjoy as I have already observed privileges unkown to their brethren in our other Colonies. And there is also this remarkable difference that at the Honduras all classes white and brown mix in society, where-as in Jamaica the brown race are wholly excluded. ... /v Burdon 3 298 /R 5B

Fm NY Commercial Advertiser of Saturday. FM HON. By the brig John R. Gardener, Capt Pederson, arrived this morning, we have a file of the Belize Observer to the 18th of June, inclusive. The papers contain more news than we generally receive fm that little out of the way corner of the world. First, we have accounts of a bloodless civil revolution in Belize. About the last of May it was rumored that the members of the Exec Cl had all sent in their resignations, in consequence of orders fm England that the Council was to be abolished; but these orders were accompanied by offers of seats on the bench of magistrates tot he members, with continuance of their honorary titles and of exemption fm jury and militia duty. All but two however, rejected these offers with noble indignation. But, to the astonishment of every body, in a day or two it was officially announced that the magistrates had been sworn in as members of the Council; so the upshot of it seems to be that the Council was not abolished, but only reorganized by the creation of a new set of Councillors. ... /North American [PA] VI 1642 p2 = 8 Jul 1844"

BELIZE, HON, March 5, 1856. A citizen of New York, a few months since, came through that place [Guat] on his way home fm California. There he fell sick, and while in that state his money—about 500 dollars—was taken fm him for safe keeping and he could not get it back when he got well. He was obliged to sell his watch and clothing to get here, where he arrived nearly a skeleton, fm exposure and want, without clothing or money, and no one to apply to for assistance. In this state he came to me and explained his situation, at the same time saying, ""this is the only place I ever was in where I could get no employment, and must either beg or steal."" This is not a solitary case; for the last seven years a great number of Americans have travelled through this town, nearly three-quarters of whom have been in a destitute condition; and as there is no government agent here they are forced to suffer. Many have sunk under it, and now rest among the dead in our burial ground. This ought not to be. Your govt should have some agent to assist your citizens when, by accident, they are destitute in foreign countries. Many or our poor ""Jacks,"" when they get here, represent themselves as English sailors, for they soon learn that there is provision made for English sailors who are destitute; that is, they are allowed one shilling sterling per day, and then they get a free passage in the Royal Mail Steamship Co. steamer to Jamaica or St. Thomas. /Weekly Herald NY XX 15 p118 = 12 Apr 1856"

We have had a Chevalier A L'Moeser, a violin player who has given two concerts (a novelty here). As a violin player he has but few equals, and gave general satisfaction; but having fallen into bad hands when he arrived here, his concerts, (excepting the flute playing by an amateur, which was very creditable) were not satisfactory to the public, yet out of respect to the talent of the Chevalier, the audience endured the singing at the first without complaint; but at the second the cry, ""Down with the singing, and let us hear the fiddle,"" was loud and long with hissing and groans. The audience, however, turned the concert into a dance, and amused themselves to a late hour in that way. Thus ended the first and only public amusement this town has had for the last eight years. /WH XVI 46

BELIZE, Hon, Dec 29, 1857. A new election for members of Assembly has just been held. The men known as opposed to the govt all received the highest votes—while the men called government men received much less. Samuel Squire Pluses, the police magistrate, a fresh Jamaica man, received only eight votes; and, if he can take it, he now has a hint of his popularity among the respectable portion of our community, for all the voters in this county are property holders, and have to possess property qualifications. ... On the adoption of the new constitution in 1852, a new Sup Ct was formed; lately a new code of practice, rules and process. These were drawn up by the AG, remodelled and amended by the Assembly, and now work very badly; in fact, they don't work at all. Right cannot be had nor justice done, unless you have the money to pay and are fortunate enough to secure the services of the AG, when you are sure to succeed. This is a bad state of things, and cannot well be altered until honest lawyers can be imported, which, I fear, is far distant, judging fm those we have had heretofore. /New York Herald Morn Ed 7809 p1 = 19 Jan 1858"

BELIZE, June 8, 1867. The House of Assy, with the consent of the Lt Gov, have granted the exclusive use and navigation of the Belize R, for a term of years, to a gentleman named Duval; and further, they have given him a subsidy, or bonus of $100 for each trip he makes, with a new steamer fm this town to the branch of the Belize R, where he has bought or secured large tracts of lands and intends making a large town. He has fully examined the whole of that neighbourhood, and reports it to be a most desirable land for a town—no flies—no insects—a delightful dry climate, at least ten degrees cooler than it is in Belize an don the seacoast; as the land is high, this is most likely the case. Then, in that vicinity coffee grows most luxuriously. /Times-Picayune XXXI 122 p2 = 15 Jun 1867

BELIZE, Oct. 3, 1867. Mr. Duval's steamboat (!) for Belize R, is a complete failure. She made nine miles in three days, and was then hauled back to town. The engines is not large enough to drive a fair corn mill, certainly not a scow against a strong current.

He brought n with his speech seven new bills, for which he asked a candid and impartial consideration, and agave encouragement for the future prospects of the colony.
