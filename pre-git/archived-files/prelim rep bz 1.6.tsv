This scarcity is owing to all the logwood which lay any way contiguous to the river being cut down and brought away since we got possession of it. So that nothing is left in the old tracks, but what lies so far back from the rivers, as makes it almost impracticable, or at least too tedious and expensive to carry it upon negroes to the water side.” /LC 1374"
